[...] Much of this material, deleted in the final version, sets forth the book's central theme of indeterminacy much more explicitly than anything in the final variant. The *Glagol* excerpt was abstruse and Proffer's response was 'almost complete incomprehension' (letter to Sokolov of August 26, 1976). [...] In his reply of August 15, 1976, Sokolov suggested that Carl Proffer's doubts echoed his own. The material had been written under difficult psychological circumstances. He had wanted to parody various styles, but felt he had not succeeded. He now proposed that the fragment be published in *Glagol* but with the idea that it would remain suspended [...] The excerpt's opening and closing passages with their descriptions of Iakov and the excursus on his name/identity were deleted"" (""Background Notes"" 337–338).",,['explanatory'],"

Bzd-yPTDEe2qUd83315PLw,Заитильщина,"The title of Ilya's chapters derives from the Tatar name of the Volga river (Itil'), and recalls the *[Zadonshchina](http://www.drevne.ru/lib/zadon_s.htm)*, an epic literary text (dated late 14th century) about the Battle of Kulikovo of 1380 (its title derives from the river Don). As ""the Zadonshchina shows the humanity of the Tatar troops and expresses genuine sympathy for a grief the Russian and Tatar alike could understand” (Halperin, *The Golden Horde *109), the Zaitil'shchina describes the diverse human universe by the Volga (Zavol'zhe), or Wolf river (Zavol'che) as it is called by paronomastic association between the terms Volga and ""volk"" (wolf). Andrei Zorin describes the setting of the novel in these terms: ""in the second novel, the directly named Zaitil'shchina, or Zavolzh'e, serves only as a symbol for a lost corner of the earth. The specific topographical realities here are deliberately scarce, and the historical ones are so thoroughly mixed up that it is absolutely impossible to reconcile the events described with any particular part of our century. And this desire of the writer for the ultimate universalization of time and space in his novel finds its most vivid expression in the role played in his artistic world by the painting of Pieter Bruegel the Elder"" (""Nasylaiushchii veter"" 252); ""The theme of physical damage in the novel becomes another embodiment of the Zaitil'shchina, a land where nothing is being built, produced, and only occasionally repaired, and more often it decays, becomes unusable, breaks and steals"" (""Nasylaiushchii veter"" 253). Vadim Kreid, titling his article ""Zaitil'shchina,"" describes the ""bezvremen'e"" (the absence of time) as the ""неизлечимая болезнь Заитильского бытия"" (incurable illness of life in Zavol'zhe), while he also points out a specific ""agnosticism"" typical of this fictional world, based on ""carelessness, inevitability of desolation, and nothingness (non-existence) as redemption"" (беспечность, неизбежность опустошения и небытие как избавление) (216-217).",,"['setting', 'structure', 'symbol', 'intertextuality', 'location', 'Russia']","

Furthermore, on a technical level, Smith writes: ""The metrical-typology of the poems in *DW*, crudely stated, is as follows. The texts fall into the conventional four groups as follows: Iambic, 8; Trochaic, 6; Ternary, 17; Other, 4; one poem is polymetric (XXXI). Compared with the norms for contemporary Russian poetry, this distribution represents much higher proportions than usual in the trochaic and ternary groups, and a reduced proportion in the iambic; that is, Sokolov is modelling a repertoire that deviates from literary verse and leans towards folkloric models. However, the two poets who made the most important contribution to the domestication and exploitation of ternary metres in Russian poetry were Nikolai Nekrasov in the mid-nineteenth century and then Boris Pasternak in his work before the mid-1920s, and Sokolov's verse evokes a strong echo of their work"" (""The Verse"" 329–330). As for the number of poems in the novel, Alexander Boguslawski writes: ""one can construct an even more tempting hypothesis that the number of chapters — 18 and the number of poems — 37 are a concealed intertextual reference to the date of Pushkin's death (1837) and to his age at death"" (""How Sokolov's"" 207).","Отсылка к написанному в 1852 году циклу рассказов Тургенева ""Записки охотника"".

Более того, с технической точки зрения, Смит пишет: ""Метрическая классификация стихов в *Между собакой и волком*, грубо говоря, следующая. Cтихи разделяются на четыре традиционные группы: Ямб, 8; Хорей, 6; Трехдольное, 17;  Другое, 4; один из стихов полиметрический (XXXI). Согласно нормам современной руской поэзии, такое распределение показывает намного большую долю хореических и трехдольных стихов, и меньшую долю ямбических; то есть, Соколов создает репертуар, отклоняющийся от литературного слога и больше напоинающий фольклорические модели. Однако, если двумя поэтами, которые внесли значимый вклад во внедрение и адаптацию трехдольного метра в русской поэзии, были Н. Некрасов в середине XIX века и Б. Пастернак в его работах до середины 1920-х, то в слоге Соколова прослеживается сходство с их работами (CASS 1987, Smith, ""The Verse"" 329–330). Что касается количества стихов в романе, А. Богуславский пишет: ""можно предложить еще более заманчивую гипотезу о том, что число глав – 18 – и число стихов – 37 – являются скрытой отсылкой к году смерти Пушкина (1837) и возрастом его смерти"" (Boguslawski, ""How Sokolov's"" 207).",['intertextuality'],"

The “lovchy” is the master of the hunt, more commonly known as “*Jägermeister*.” Sokolov himself worked as gamekeeper between May 1972 and November 1973 at a hunting estate located near [Bezborodovo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bezborodovo,+Tver+Oblast,+Russia,+171266/@56.579525,36.4408015,12z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x46b5cb242835d1ad:0xabad2cea6e8a9056!8m2!3d56.5870557!4d36.4902766!16s%2Fg%2F1235dh_lb?entry=ttu) in the Kalinin oblast (today Tver').

zR8m6Cq9Ee2BzpevBLjOwA,запойного охотника,"That is, Yakov. These verse segments are allegedly written by Yakov during his year on the Volga; they come divided in sections according to the time of the year, which is however never a specific season but a period between seasons. In these first Notes, the setting is fall-winter. Gerald Smith suggests that the ""idea of going to the country for the winter rather than the summer is a calculated reversal of the accepted routine of polite society, and a fundamental aspect of the novel's anti-'civilized' stance"" (""The Verse"" 325). In opposition to most critics, he also proposes that the Notes are composed by a ""controlling intelligence"" beyond the novel's main characters (""The Verse"" 326). Alcohol theme.A different interpretation is advanced by Leiderman and Lipovetsky, who interpret the novel as a tripartite narration, unfolded progressively by Ilya, Yakov, and a third “impersonal author” (Russkaia literatura xx veka, 407). However, as Napolitano underlines, ""In such a drunk atmosphere, not only the narrative staggers, due to the blurred vision of its narrators, but the reader, too, wavers in following the flows of the voices weaving together the narrative texture. These voices are not simply Ilya’s and Yakov’s (and his alternative personalities, including the Binging Hunter’s), but Maria-Orina also shows up, accompanied for instance by a nineteenth-century porter, or even a certain Carus Sterne with his natural history book *Werden und Vergehen*. Thus, we are presented with Maria’s notebook, containing “sufferings in the Russian language.” Orina will take the floor and open chapter 10 describing her life “in the barracks,” being “known as a walker and turned into a typical strumpet.” Elsewhere, “God only knows how long their confusion would have lasted if the porter Avdey, a sleepy peasant with a pitch-black beard reaching up to his dull and birdlike tiny eyes and with a similarly dull metal badge, did not come to say to the master that they should not be angry – the samovar completely broke” (and, of course, instead of a tea then, he suggests that they sip some “fresh beer”) (CASS, ""Studyin this Volapuke"", 291).

I'd also add this to your annotation, after you write ""are allegedly written by Yakov"": ""to the extent we can assume he is the author of the Notes – and such a first name, so close to the Russian word iakoby, makes him literally only ‘allegedly’ a hunter, a wannabe poet/artist, or, more generally speaking, a round and authentic character"" (Napolitano, CASS, ""Studyin this Volapuke"", 292). 
[of course, it is not necessary to quote myself, we can also re-write these ideas; it was just easier to copy-paste them :) ]","То есть, Яков. Можно предположить, что эти стихотворные фрагменты написаны Яковом во время его годового пребывания на Волге; они разделены на части согласно временам года, однако, не конкретным сезонам, а межсезоньям. В первых Записках время действия — осень-зима. Дж. Смит предполагает, что ""идея ехать в деревню зимой, а не летом, умышленно противопоставляется общепринятому обычаю приличного общества и является фундаментальным аспектом анти-цивилизованной позиции романа"" (CASS, ""The Verse"", 325). Вопреки мнению большинства критиков, он также считает, что Записки созданы неким ""управляющим разумом"" за пределами круга главных героев романа (CASS, ""The Verse"", 326).
