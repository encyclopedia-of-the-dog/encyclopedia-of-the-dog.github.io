[...] Неоспоримый фокус “сказа” Ильи на устном творчестве — через бесчисленные аллюзии к сказкам и басням — и устной речи, особенно ее воспринимаемым на слух качествам, отображенным через парономазию, противопоставляется литературности и образности прозаическим и стихотворным фрагментам (Kravchenko *The Prose* 80). Она описывает структуру романа следующим образом: “Структура романа, за исключением главы 18 […], образует систему кривых зеркал. Первая и последняя главы — сказ, вторая и предпоследняя — проза, третья и пятнадцатая — стихи, затем вновь две главы, отражающие повествование Ильи (4 и 14), повествование в прозе (5 и 13), Ильи (6 и 12), в стихах (7 и 11) и снова Ильи (8 и 10). Структура складывается посередине, на девятой главе, написанной прозой, образуя при этом ‘переплет’, скрепляющий книгу” (Kravchenko *The Prose* 53–54).",['structure'],"

The ""Notes"" (Записки) trope is common in Russian literature: *Notes of a Rifle Hunter* (Aksakov), Notes of a Shallow Grass (Dryansky), ""Notes of a Madman"" (Gogol), *Notes from the Underground* (Dostoevsky), *Notes from a Dead House* (Dostoevsky), ""Notes of a Madman"" (Tolstoy), ""Notes of a Christian"" (Tolstoy), *Notes of a Doctor* (Veresaev), *Notes of a Young Doctor* (Bulgakov), *Notes of a Psychotic* (Ven.

However, the two poets who made the most important contribution to the domestication and exploitation of ternary metres in Russian poetry were Nikolai Nekrasov in the mid-nineteenth century and then Boris Pasternak in his work before the mid-1920s, and Sokolov's verse evokes a strong echo of their work"" (""The Verse"" 329–330).

Произведение получило признание за отражение крестьянской жизни. Образ ""Записок"" нередко встречается в русской литературе: *Записки ружейного охотника* (Аксаков), ""Записки мелкотравчатого"" (Дриянский), ""Записки сумасшедшего"" (Гоголь), *Записки из подполья* (Достоевский), *Записки из Мертвого дома* (Достоевский), ""Записки сумасшедшего"" (Толстой), ""Записки христианина"" (Толстой), *Записки врача* (Вересаев), *Записки юного врача* (Булгаков), *Записки психопата* (Вен. Ерофеев), *Записки неохотника* (Ванталов). Дж. Смит предполагает, что Запойный охотник может быть литературным потомком пушкинского героя из поэмы ""Цыгане"" (CASS 1987, Smith, ""The Verse"", 329). Более того, с технической точки зрения, Смит пишет: ""Метрическая классификация стихов в *Между собакой и волком*, грубо говоря, следующая. Cтихи разделяются на четыре традиционные группы: Ямб, 8; Хорей, 6; Трехдольное, 17;  Другое, 4; один из стихов полиметрический (XXXI). Согласно нормам современной руской поэзии, такое распределение показывает намного большую долю хореических и трехдольных стихов, и меньшую долю ямбических; то есть, Соколов создает репертуар, отклоняющийся от литературного слога и больше напоинающий фольклорические модели. Однако, если двумя поэтами, которые внесли значимый вклад во внедрение и адаптацию трехдольного метра в русской поэзии, были Н. Некрасов в середине XIX века и Б. Пастернак в его работах до середины 1920-х, то в слоге Соколова прослеживается сходство с их работами (CASS 1987, Smith, ""The Verse"" 329–330). Что касается количества стихов в романе, А. Богуславский пишет: ""можно предложить еще более заманчивую гипотезу о том, что число глав – 18 – и число стихов – 37 – являются скрытой отсылкой к году смерти Пушкина (1837) и возрастом его смерти"" (Boguslawski, ""How Sokolov's"" 207).",['intertextuality'],"

KvjkgFidEe6BuDtfcNyQQw,Discords Beyond the Itil,"The title of Ilya's chapters in Russian, *Zaitil'shchina*, derives from the Tatar name of the Volga river (Itil'), and recalls (in Russian, Zaitil'shchina) the Zadonshchina, an epic literary text (dated late 14th century) about the Battle of Kulikovo of 1380 (its title derives from the river Don). As ""the Zadonshchina shows the humanity of the Tatar troops and expresses genuine sympathy for a grief the Russian and Tatar alike could understand” (Halperin, *The Golden Horde *109), the Zaitil'shchina describes the diverse human universe by the Volga (Zavol'zhe), or Wolf river (Zavol'che) as it is called by paronomastic association between the terms Volga and ""volk"" (wolf). Andrei Zorin describes the setting of the novel in these terms: ""in the second novel, the directly named Zaitil'shchina, or Zavolzh'e, serves only as a symbol for a lost corner of the earth. The specific topographical realities here are deliberately scarce, and the historical ones are so thoroughly mixed up that it is absolutely impossible to reconcile the events described with any particular part of our century. And this desire of the writer for the ultimate universalization of time and space in his novel finds its most vivid expression in the role played in his artistic world by the painting of Pieter Bruegel the Elder"" (""Nasylaiushchii veter"" 252); ""The theme of physical damage in the novel becomes another embodiment of the Zaitil'shchina, a land where nothing is being built, produced, and only occasionally repaired, and more often it decays, becomes unusable, breaks and steals"" (""Nasylaiushchii veter"" 253). Vadim Kreid, titling his article ""Zaitil'shchina,"" describes the ""bezvremen'e"" (the absence of time) as the ""неизлечимая болезнь Заитильского бытия"" (incurable illness of life in Zavol'zhe), while he also points out a specific ""agnosticism"" typical of this fictional world, based on ""carelessness, inevitability of desolation, and nothingness (non-existence) as redemption"" (беспечность, неизбежность опустошения и небытие как избавление) (216-217).",,"['setting', 'structure', 'symbol', 'Russia', 'intertextuality', 'location']","
