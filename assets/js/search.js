  content: "The moonth’s clear1, no catchin2 up with the dates3, the \nyear’s current. To Citizen4 Sidor Fomich5 Pozhilykh6, \nwith all due respect, Ilya Petrikeich Zynzyrela’s7 Discords8 Beyond the Itil9 10. With Your11 permission12, I commence. Citizen Pozhilykh, I’m a man relatively13 peripheral to these places14, \nbut since I’m a sharpener15, hence I sharpen knives-scissors, and \nit would be probably rather difficult to pull the wool over my \neyes, even if at first glance I am a total gimp16. I also happen to \nsharpen scythes, axes, and other hardwear, but such details \nwould only obscure my account. That’s why I don’t recount the \nevents of the years out-of-sight-and-out-of-mind, just lemme \nunderscore that up ’til now I haven’t found myself in the slammer17, despite18 dwellin in substantial towns19. Wherever they’d settle me, I didn’t mind bein down and out, didn’t seriously hanker after a family20, and made ends meet by askin folks for help in \nproportion to their means and possibilities. About that I remain remorseful, havin chosen for this purpose a co-op of invaliduals named after A. Sharpenhauer. I beg Your pardon, of \ncourse, but a dedicated work den and a bill of fare are available. \nWhen it’s warm, we do them knives all the time: We wander \naround and set out to find employment far away. In contrast, \nwhen it’s freezin, we service the populace in regard to sharpenin and flattenin ’cuz from November to April, every day \nwithout holidays, loners and monsters similar to this here correspondent of Yourses clink and circle on the mirror of the waters, and when the dusk descends, You welcome them in the \nthree-story sickler, aptly named by a whim of some passerby a \ncrashbaret; but Thou shall not find Ilya in their midst. You’ll \nturn blue: Why is he such a nincompoop, why doesn’t he procure for himself a pair of blades, like them other folks, is he \ndisgusted by the prospect of scratchin what’s smooth with his \nsharps, is he snubbin a mugful of beneficially social brew? No \nway, I would never refuse what I’m used to and I’m not one of \nthem sharpeners who ain’t sharp. To tell the truth, I don’t need \na pair, but one attachable blade always hangs over the mantelpiece. It don’t matter, really, that I became, unfortunately, damaged, if by nature I am flintlike: I fell in love with glidin and \ncan’t be held back, just as long as there’s somethin to push off \nwith—ding once, Mister Pozhilykh, dong once, keep swayin, \nkeep mutterin under the shaft bow even as far as the Valday \nharbor—castin of bells, bakin of pretzels, peddlin of hemp—\nand no one can boss you around along the Itil. May I prolong? \nBut what’s precisely happenin is that lately there ain’t nothin to \npush off with. On the fourth Thursday of December (read: on \nChristmas Eve), I was walkin from the other side of the river, \nsteppin forth from one of them undertakers, probably unknown to You. We were sendin off a certain recluse who skated \nto his maker due to his haughty recklessness. He lived in \nMylo—one could say—mukomolovo, but on the outskirts, in \nclusters of adder’s tongue with an admixture of willow; he was \na hunter, perpetually kept postal cooers, altogether quite \nfurry-legged, but I doubt that he conducted correspondence \nwith anyone: It’s unlikely. However, he himself shuttlecocked \ncrisp like lime bast in scorchin heat, and he was called—I don’t \nremember what. Gury—that’s what he was called, as long as \nwe’re on it. Among the amusements of that particular Gury I’d \nreference the followin: He was the one that adored scrapin and \nrollin over the slick on his sharps, which additionally resulted \nin us losin a client, and the undertakers, in contrast, findin one. \nI’ll provide evidence right away. In the days of the Archer, to \nmake it more dangerous, but more excitin, the loners of both \nShallow Reach shores arrange races on the weakenin ice. It \nhappens in the outer darkness, intentionally without heavenly \nlights, and the folks cut figures as well as they can and hurry- \nscurry playin catch and chasin each other, without seein the \nholes and cracks. And that’s fraughtful. In matters of whirlin, \neverybody was always scorched by a certain Nikolay, a lad \nfrom, when everythin was said and done, the trash co-op. With \nthe overly familiar nickname Helper, he played a sincere loser \nin this world, and some jokers among the envious ones meanly \nmade fun of him, sayin that he shows off so fancifully only ’cuz \nhe’s got a knack for lurkin around dark corners; so, they said, \nhe’s used to it. What is the chronicle of his failures, if You don’t \nmind? He, first of all, tasted the familial pandemonium, but his \nspouse got together with a wolf slayer and chased the Helper \naway from the house, second of all. Then, he knocked on the \nGorodnishche shelter for the unhearin, but they showed him \nthe door and no more: Our department’s exclusively for the \ndeaf, and you, as you can see, are also blind, so you understand \nyourself. For that reason the fellow shuffled to the sightless \nshelter: Fat chance, the limit of bunk spots has been exceeded; \nanother thing if you had your own concertina, you’d hang \naround the embarcaderos and just put the proceeds into the \ncommon pot, and for that we would keep you. So Nikolay \nHelperov stood up in front of them in his entire shriveled \nheight and, angrily cryin with his burnin walleyes, shouted: \nYou overseas seedpods, if I had my own musick, would I ask \nyou what to do, really? And at the next stage he turned up without warnin in the house of the transient homeless, and they \nstepped into his shoes politely, and splashed wholeheartedly. \nAnd they tempted: Live, brother, forever. And one day this \ndame has called on one of them; she notices the Helper in the \nmidst of the other poor, in their circle: Who’s the one so unsightly over there among you at the rink? Not to worry; it’s just \nNikolka here among us skatin at the rink. His circumstance is \nprobably not too shabby, she says, if he’s spinnin so lively. No, \nthey said, it’s not good, his circumstance sucks, the only joy he \nhas left is to weave them figures. Then the dame: No, stop, you \nbetter don’t let him clown around, just look at him, how unappealin. So the almshouse’s tenants asked the Helper: Do us a \nfavor, do not live, brother, forever, ’cuz there are reprimands. \nHe did not answer nothin, as he had, besides everythin else, \nthe reputation of a mute, and he set out far from the establishment and didn’t even look back. And the co-op of collectin all \nkinds of trash received him warmly. They reported he didn’t \nshine there with excessively long service, but durin a drunken \nincident got slightly upset and vanished somewhere, and it’s \nrather unlikely he’ll return. This is, if You don’t mind, this \nchronicle. One wonders: Did I sharpen his unsharpened ones? \nAnd it turns out only I and nobody else from the entire collective did his sharpenin, while the remainin co-workers, squeamish, turned up their noses, even though they themselves were \npachoolies not of the first freshness. I also sharpened for Gury, \nand for Krylobyl, and for the Wintry Man I sharpened, for the \nentire Itil, You understand, I sharpened. And as to Gury the \nHunter, he was makin a career in race-skatin. Every chance he \ngets, he wants nothin else, just let him fly over the slick. Sometimes he would fly into the co-op’s workshop, would fall, like a \nlong-awaited rain durin the drought, would drop in, slightly \ntired, and what are we supposed to do?—we chip in a ruble \neach. And we start countin: Gury leaves the misty glade, from \nhis pocket draws a blade; I will sharpen his blade fine, and \nyou’ll have to get the wine. If I—with sadness, but I’m ready. \nOnce I wanted to tether the skate to my boot, but at that moment I noticed it longed after a rasp. Drat—the rasp got completely lost or the colleagues snagged it. Gury graciously \nthought for a while and said: What are you lookin for, tell? \nI told him. He told them: Eh, you, mechanics, return the strument, whoever snagged it, ’cuz your mate has been palmin after \nit for a long time. But the co-op answered: Buzz off; what the \nheck do we need his freakin rasp for? And also: What, do you \nthink he will dash on the rasp to Sloboda? And You will probably start doubtin too: Does it make sense, bein based in the \nproximity of the crashbaret, to run seven verstas to Sloboda \non a wild-goose chase—either on the rasp or on the crasp? \nDon’t doubt, for, after all, the victim of the wager hurries not \nempty-handed; he is trundlin in a sack on his mighty hump \nglasswear collected in the dales and in the hills. And—perhaps \nYou’re still completely out of the loop—I hasten to give You \nadvance notice. In the crashbaret, due to some kind of false \npride, they don’t accept them empties at all and trade for takeout with great scandals, by what, from the human point, they \ncommit a commercial blunder. A very different picture can be \nseen in the joint at the tributary, beyond the ridge of curly, but \nat the first sight insignificant islands. Over there, what’s yours \nwill be accepted at a fair price, without fuss, and the stuff you \nhad paid for you have the right to use both inside and outside. \nAnd Gury to the grinders point-blank: Well, even on the rasp. \nAnd afterward, he again to them again: For Ilya it’s probably \ninconvenient to use the rasp, but I, obviously, could like a \ncharm. Then and there they started eggin him on, Citizen \nPozhilykh. We believe, we believe, among us you are a famous \nmarathon whiz, you grew yourself such femurs—first quality, \nboth thin and long; how can we stick our pitiful bonesies \nwhere they don’t belong, and Ilya the Malformed even more? I \nwon’t hide it, there can be mug shots worse, but scarce. For \ninstance, the game warden, Manul, who used to go after his fastidious needs to the Other Places, reported he had met there \nmonstrosities even more atrocious. That means not everythin \nis lost, my dear, and as long as I manage somehow to hold the \nmallet and the whetstone, I will not count myself among the \nluckless, so don’t look for despair in Ilya. I’ve found the rasp, \nwhisked away the burr, and come out, loaded, on the river. I am \naimin slantily, at an angle, and since the ice is thin, the entire \nriver is under me, like opened. I reach the tributary. On it, after \nacceleratin ’cuz it’s calm, I wheel up to Sloboda itself. I don’t \ndrag out the tittle-tattle there too much, I’m in a hurry. I perform a lawful purchase-sale, turn around, and swing back, and \nthe dusk keeps whirlin above my foolish bean, and my Sharpenhauers light for me from afar a storm lamp, so I won’t glide, \nagainst my will, by the workshops. We had a few then. You’ll \noutrun us, wretches, as if we were standin in place, the co-op \negged on, racin with you, Gury, we’re passes. Yep, mechanics, \nyep, here, among you all, I am the only wiry runner. Just look, \nhe told them, just look at all our hoar-frosted expanses, there’s \nno one I wouldn’t out-swoosh; where could such a lad be? We \nlit up, started chewin the fat, and went out to smoke in the \ncold. We stood on a hillock; behind us, a large wooden town—\nthere the fellas go on a wild bender—and lower, in front of us, \na river’s reach, spread stock-still like on the palm of a hand. \nLook around, Gury informed the masters, there, on the righthand side, we have a settlement, Malokulebyakovo. And who \nlives down there? Who only doesn’t live in Kulebyakovo, the \nco-op’s workmen answered evasively. For instance, a wellknown miller-fatso happens to exist there, barely carried by the \nearth, not to mention the ice, and at the mill the miller’s got a \nChink, Aladdin, but we understand it won’t be no honor for \nyou to race with him. And one can also locate in Kulebyakovo \na certain game warden who, as rumors have it, fell into a dry \nwell. He’s screamin, but nobody can hear him, and his wife \nknows where he is, but ain’t interested in gettin him out ’cuz \nshe’s doin hanky-panky with a neybor, also a game warden, but \nmore younger; betcha he had messed her head up. In one word, \nthe game wardens are busy, not into racin. And besides them \nthere’s no one in the village. And in Ploski among more or less \nrunners one can find the youngster Nikolay who never had his \nown name or, more precisely, had, but too long ago. And when \nthat Nikolay the Helper went thru his transfiguration and flew \naway, this one snatched his name for himself—he did not allow, as they say, the goods to get wasted. And Gury again: And \nif he likes to snip some fish, it’s no problem at all, and no reason \nfor the fishermen to take offense and wish his demise. Just \nthink—a man steals a few fishes from people and they have \nfound themselves a reason to chew him out. True, Gury, true, \nthe livin creatures—whether free or in snares—they’re clearly \nnobody’s, and if somebody’s after all, then we know Whose, \nbut in that case all the trappers here, it appears, are the most \ngreatest poachers in front of Him. And in vain, in vain they \nbumped Nikola off one day. Here he is, by the way, takin their \ncatch from their under-the-ice traps beyond the islands. He \ntied his sack, put it on his sled, and started pullin. He’s shiverin, \nthe blizzard has blasted his longsighted orbs, his valenki are \nworn out, he lost his mittens, his skates ain’t sharpened, and \nthe annoyin Wolfox shows right up. Throw me a fishie, he \nthreatens Nikolay, throw me another, otherwise I’ll send darkness on the Itil. Night scares Nikolay from Ploski more than \ndeath, so he unconditionally throws into the woods a triple of \nsturgeons for the Wolfox. ’Cuz, after all, if he won’t make it to \nGorodnishche before dark, he won’t get the funds for the \nstuff; if he won’t get the funds for the stuff, he won’t drop in to \nthe crashbaret; if he won’t drop in to the crashbaret, he won’t \nhave fun with them comrades; and not to have fun with them \ncomrades, then, really, why donkey work like that, Citizen \nPozhilykh, You be the judge. And while these activists are \nwaitin for Nikolay with heavy clubs at the edge of the village, \nhe approaches the suburbs with half a sack of silvery sturgeons \nand green slimy tenches. He declares: I salute you, the most \nmerriest town of bast, hail to you, tall painted cockroach \ntowers. Oh, my dear town, he says, give shelter for the upcomin \nnight to the unlucky fisherman killed by foes, buy his goods, \ngive him some monies to jingle in his pocket; may the old \nman’s wrinkles become smooth; may the lonely bat spread his \nfolded wings. And don’t be a cheapskate; pour me, town, to the \nrim. And also, he says, introduce me, town, to some lonesome \nbabe with high cheekbones and a tender heart. So he took off \nhis skates and started walkin, walkin up the hill, that Nikolay \nfrom Ploski, and a hellish host of have-nots hurries to meet \nhim, without haste: Give us and give us, they go, some of your \ncatches for Christ’s sake, otherwise it’ll be even worse. Esteemed \nbeggars, the splashers in my sack ain’t mine, ’cuz everythin \naround us here, includin the spindles of speckled clouds, and \nthe river, and the boats that like big-bellied widows lie strewn, \nabandoned, with their stomachs up, around the bathhouses, as \nwell as our rags and we ourselves who are wearin them—all \nthis is not mine and not yours. We know, we know, nodded the \npaupers, laughin like possessed, in that case give us, nevertheless, a tail per soul; give us, furthermore, fishes that ain’t yours. \nI see, Nikolay wails to the hapless ones on the hill, I see that it’ll \nbe, I reckon, rather hard to take you for a ride. And he hands \neach one a tench. Where could he go—the poor are legion and \nhe’s alone. A lonely man on the road, especially when such a \nblue haze hangs over the Volga, he, allow me to note, is alone in \nthe entire world. Nikolay gives each one a tail and enters the \nwooden December town with the rest of his booty, and knocks \nwith his ancient walkin stick on the gates of resonatin courtyards, and curses snarly mongrels bitin the frozen chains. And \nwe’re still standin on the riverbank; so far not many stars are \nshinin above us, but still. And Gury the Hunter, he announces \nwithout beatin around the bushes: To run races with Nikolay \nfrom Ploski, even if I do respect him a little, I don’t consider \ndecent; in my opinion, he’s both decrepit and vain—I’ll outscrape him and embarrass.\n\nBut ain’t clickin, somebody suddenly said, ain’t smartin over \nthere, in Ploski, that Fyodor, on the abacus of his? That is, not \nnecessarily Fyodor but sorta Pyotr. And, in general—Yegor. \nHis occupation was listed as an accounter, but even he, as it \nwas revealed afterward, was a first-rate thief: That’s with whom \nGury should have done his racin. Do You understand what \nhappened? Well, when that dame appeared without warnin on \nthe spit, they—mostly the local sitters out of the game \nwardens—sat there and observed the flight of geese, like almost always, but about this sittin very few outsiders have any \nidea ’cuz what’s happenin takes place in the bushes and in twilights and is hidden from those sailin on the water, and when \nthey sit on the spit and have a few, this dame comes to them, \ninquirin: Say, is there among you the one I’m searchin for? \nWell, how should we put it, they shrug their shoulders, look for \nyourself, we only beg you to notice that we’re all first-class and \nready for everythin and anythin just to please you, the gatecharmer of our places. She started lookin for herself and later \nannounced: I don’t see among you the one I’m searchin for, \nbut I’m noticin another one who would do for now. And she’s \nlookin at Pyotr. Cruel shivers seized the accounter, the bookkeeper flared up as if a bright flame went blazin through his \nveins. And he made an announcement, gettin up and shakin off \nhurrily-scurrily. He made an announcement, gettin up from \nthe damp earth, where he was to transfer in the mere future: \nI am Yegor from Ploski; lead me wherever you wish. The dame \nled him, the happy one, wherever she wished, and the sitters \ndrank, chewed their chasers, and were jealous of Pyotr. After a \nfew days he returned to the spit, and they surrounded him and \nkept askin: So, Petra, did you happen to have a sweet stroll? \nThe sitters kept askin Fyodor, to learn if he had a sweet time \nwith the dame. And he conveyed almost nothin to them, but \nsaid this: It was so that better don’t even ask. Well, but still—\nthe wolfmen did not back off—but still, was your visit with her \nsweeter than a home brew? Don’t ask, answered Pyotr, not \neven by hintin. Was the past sweeter than krambambuli for \nyou, they asked nevertheless. What krambambuli, Fyodor, enraged, surprised them, everythin went sweeter than Valday rotgut. So they had a few then to Pyotr’s return, and he off the cuff \nadmits with tears that he’s not considerin returnin to his heartthrob; the past is canceled, and that’s why he don’t need nothin, \nfor what could he personally need after all that happened between the two of them; moreover, recollections don’t promise \nforgettin; memory, brother, don’t go on debit but on credit. \nAnd that’s a fact; as far as this is concerned, my dear Pozhilykh, \nYou can depend on me, the one who once suffered a crash at a \nhigh speed. It did not work out for you, Ilya Zynzyrella, you \ngot deformed, warped like a sheet of plywood. We muddled by \nin the countryside, we huddled in a happy-go-lucky marriage \nin Orina’s burrow, havin forgotten about problems and permits. I won’t swear that our relationship rolled on smoothly, \nbut do stress—in the beginnin it was bearable. It became unbearable, when from the switch, where she used to sort couriers, expresses, and alike, and where due to the shortage of free \ntime hanky-panky was not really goin thru, they transferred my \nqueen to the brick tower and made her a dispecher—to release \ntrain cars from the sortin hill. It won’t do you any good that \nyou, Ilya, purred, anticipatin her bonus for cleanliness, you \nsang “Joy,” she lives, you kept sayin, in a tall tower, you whistled, not expectin major changes. Only afterward you latched \non that, hounded by the ramjunctious boredom, she hitched \nherself to couplers, ran into the maintenance boors, and that if \nsomeone was not allowed into the tall tower—it was none else \nbut you, my dear. And, havin latched on, at first you still joked: \nOrya, stop gettin filthy with them in unmown ditches, it’s \nkinda not right; after all, they’re just not good, this railroad \nbrood. That’s how you joked, findin inside smidgens of \nstrength, even if every so often you could bear it no longer. \nPlump, curvaceous, brushin her hair with the hair pick at dawn, \nshe kept givin me runarounds: How do you know if good or \nnot? Meanwhile, I was lyin on my cot and emittin fumes, not \nwillin to get up—what for, I don’t have to hurry nowhere no \nmore. She kept givin me runarounds, and there was no place to \nput a proof of purity on her, and the hair pick—once I looked \nmore carefully—was not the one I presented to her on Ascension. I skinflinted, humbled myself in distant domiciles to \npurchase it, denied myself the necessities through the entire \nleaf-slayer, and then—when I looked more carefully—a \ndifferent one. I started wondrin. Our attraction turned into \ndust; I should take off—with no sack, no bag, and no footwear. \nBut I am not awfully mighty, I get attached; instead, I kept diggin, persuadin. What kind of a special hair pick, Oryushka, \nhave you got? A hair pick like any other, she says thru her teeth, \nclutchin pins-hairpins in them. Hmm, and mine, the one I gave \nyou, you’re still takin care of it, ain’t you? You bet, you bet, I \ntook it to a museum; she shrewdly reins me in with her tongue. \nOn the rails, she stretches the truth, I lost that hair pick, and \nthat’s all there’s to it. I was cowerin like a panic-stricken animal \ndurin the hunt, I kept proddin, fallin into doubts: Hmm, and \nthis one, in that case, by what ruse did you get it, did someone \ngive it to you? And the dawn, I note in passin, is breakin in the \nwindow and in the mirror, turnin into a first-class iridescent \nazure, and Orina’s downrite bathin there, supplethal, she’s \nsplashin, exactly like in our promised pond in devil knows \nwhich summer, roughly in the month of July. Those days we \nhaven’t yet shared affections, she kept deceivin, postponin—\nlater and later—and I kept waitin and bearin it, encouraged. \nAnd two empty cable reels floated there, swellin, like at many \nother reservoirs. She’s thrown off all her fabrics on the bush of \nstag-head and steps out on the edge—shameless. Well, and \nthen I got plugged up with the shoe cord; the threaded tape \ntightened like a noose. There’s no way to break it, I was dealt a \nstubborn specimen. In short, I undid that knot with my teeth: \nThey were still present. And Orina was standin in her cheap \npearls only, but she herself was priceless, just try to find another one like that. I did not count how many others I happened to have before her, but up to my mutilation I did not \nenjoy casual joys aplenty. And those joys, really—should you \nlaugh or cry? They all make faces, all fuss around, they tease—\nI’ll give or I won’t give, afraid to be too cheap, as if I, a braggart \nfool, really could offer them, fancy-schmancies, anythin in exchange. And the main thing, when you finally calm them \ndown, even then everythin somehow turns out topsy-turvy, \ncrumpled, not complete, and quite often without real comforts. \nAnd as far as allowin themselves to give it up—never, not for \nthe world: They stand on ceremony. In Orina’s case—I suddenly saw her in all her simplicity, and fell in enrapture, of \ncourse. I could not bear it and I let her understand, by singin a \nstanza from one wonderful aria. You do look pretty, say, in any \ndress, but when you’re naked you look best. It would have been \nbetter, however, if I had been less of a songbird in love, and \nmore looked ahead; perhaps I would have noticed besides the \nreal knot on the shoe cord the comin knot of a slightly different \nkind—where the freight trains are sorted, that is the choochoo switch with various semafors and clever whatchamacallits like greasers’ hooks and the greasers in person, deftly wormin themselves in without soap where they shouldn’t. The first \nknot—thanks to the flashes of summer lightnin—I managed \nto untie, but the sortin one—even if all the nights there are full \nof fire—brought out of the blue a muddle unfatomable to any \nmind. But right now, I repeat, Orina stood there white and \nshiny, like a saber in the moonlight. To be honest, all in all it \nwas bearable, but I remember for me personally it was unbearable; I wanted to learn as soon as possible what she was doin, \nand with whom, and when, that is to worm out all her ins and \nouts. It’s not enough for you, lecherous Ilya, just to dupe and \nforce the woman, no, you, like an irrepressible spider, suck out \nof her drop after drop the tincture of confessions, drawin from \nit the strength of pity, in order to approach and force her again. \nAnd Orina stood for a while on the edge of the pond and \nstepped in, and I, havin disrobed, took a dive. I dived deeply, \nwith opened eyelids; I stared—the liquid glaze. The eye of the \nworld was this pond with reels; a polished opal in the settin of \nbluish clay, clumps of willows and long slimy weeds it was. \nAnd where are our crucians?—suddenly came to my mind. \nI screwed up my eyes—they kept nappin in their holes, shaded \nby the banks, under the snags. And the snails, that is the mussels? I love them. Knockin around the world on account of my \nservices with the lonely acordeon of mine or with a grindin \nfoot-operated stand, wandrin in the dale of the beloved river \nItil, worn out and not fond of myself, I ate countless numbers \nof the latter. Do they taste good? You see, I won’t spare praises: \nYummy. In the unheard-of area that shelters the ancientest \ntribe of the deaf, for whom your entire filharmonic is useless, \nor in a dull district, where nobody cuts, slices, or chops anythin \nout of rampant laziness; in the unheard-of district or in the dull \narea oblivious to the runnin out of the uselessly wasted light, \nwhen you played for the residents and they did not pay attention, or when you implored if they wanted to have this or that \nsharpened in order to get from them just enough to keep the \npot boilin, but they did not bring out even the tiniest needle, \nyou should find out from the old water yoke the way to the \nriver and scamper, empty-bellied, to pay her a visit, as if you \nwere goin to your mother-in-law for a formal borscht. Limp \nalong the high roads on the only existin leg, hobble through \nwater meadows, shaded by sparklin precious coverlet. What’s \nthat, what seems to have twinkled there so dimly, like that \nquiverin rot at the Bydogoshch cemetery? What flickered like \nsilver in the pea shrubs, sorta resemblin a shimmer of your rugged aluminum mug in the rips of your never-mended bag? \nWhat glimmered there with the cold light of the flash, as if \nfrom under the fold of a merchant’s coat at the market, the vessel from Crystal Goose with the priceless blue hooch sparked \nstraight in your dried-out eyes? What is flutterin there like a \nsarafan’s ruche, what is flappin there like mother-in-law’s \ntongue? What and what—such an annoyin whatter, you’re \nnothin but trouble. My buddy, this is the Wolf River, your kin. \nYou tell her: Halloo, my sister, I’m in distress, quench my thirst \nwith your current, feed the tramp with your mussels, gimme as \nmany of them as you can, I enjoy their taste. Provide just them \n’cuz salt and matches I always have on me; and, obviously, lay \nme down to sleep along the current of yours, place the softest \nstone under my nape. And she says: Upon examination, Ilyusha from Gorodnishchi, I don’t begrudge you nothin; for instance, water—drink ’til you burst; and the same situation \nwith the mussels—chomp and don’t count. And the stone—if \nyou want, I’ll give it to you to put under your head or, if you \nwant, on your neck, and then keep restin to your health even to \nthe Lastest Judgment.\n\n\n  \n    \n      A combination of “moon” and “month.” This expression hides a double meaning, as the word “mesiats” may mean both “moon” and “month” in Russian. The author is at once suggesting that “the month is clear” (a rather indeterminate time setting) and that “the moon shines”. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Translator Alexander Boguslawski has rendered the voice of Ilya in this colloquial manner to approximate the original Russian narration’s style. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Typical sample of Sokolov’s non-linear conception of time (see, for instance, R.C. Borden, “Time, backward!: Sasha Sokolov and Valentin Kataev,” in CASS 21 (3-4) 1987, 247-263, A School for Fools, and Palisandriia. Классический пример нелинеарного восприятия времени (см., например, с критической точки зрения, R.C. Borden, Time, backward!: Sasha Sokolov and Valentin Kataev, in CASS 21 (3-4) 1987, 247-263, и Школа для дураков / Палисандрия). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Sokolov avoids using the most common Soviet appellative “comrade” opting for a rather general, but still evocative word: “citizen” (grazhdanin). This word evokes the poem “Poet and Citizen” by the 19th-c Nikolai Nekrasov. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Sidor (shortened form of Isidor), son of Foma. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      An unusual surname, which does not permit standard declension. It literally means “elderly.” &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Again an unusual last name (which is printed in more than ten different versions in the book). It carries allusions to Cinderella. Ilya, who is missing a leg, is associated with footwear. (see L. Toker’s essay,”Gamesman’s Sketches (Found in a Bottle),” CASS 21.3-4: 356). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Disagreement or disharmony between people, things, or music. In his chapters, Ilya tells the story of his troubles with the hunters. More generally, this translation of the original title (Zaitil’shchina, The Epic Tale Beyond the Itil’) might also refer to the confluence and disharmony between the various narrative voices in the novel: Ilya’s letter, the chapters concerning Yakov’s life and thoughts, and Yakov’s poetry. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      A Turkic (Khazar) name for the Volga River, specifically the lower course of the Volga from the mouth to the confluence with the Kama, the section of the Kama to the confluence with the White, and the entire course of the White. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      The title that Ilya gives to his missive to Pozhilykh. Its name echoes that of the Zadonschina, a Russian manuscript of late 14th century, about the Battle of Kulikovo (1380) between Russians and Mongols. The contents of Ilya’s letters concern the events related to his life and death that occur “beyond the Itil River.” In this way, the story Ilya tells Pozhilykh becomes a real epic poem. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Capitalization of “You” and “Your” is used by the translator to signify the Russian formal register (Vy, rather than ty). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Imitation of oral speech, which contradicts the written form of Ilya’s “letter.” &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      A slight contradiction in semantics (how can one be only “relatively” an outsider?). Everything is relative in the novel: time, place, identity. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      \n        Insignificant, unknown, unfamiliar to the setting and its inhabitants. Ilya as itinerant knife-grinder.2. Setting along the Volga River, far from society.3. Blurred spatial dimension of the novel.\n      \n      &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      One of Ilya’s occupations: knife-grinding. He also sharpens the blades that the hunters use to skate on the frozen river. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      \n        A person with a physical disability or leg injury. Ilya has lost a leg.2. Twisted silk, worsted, or cotton with cord or wire running through it, used chiefly as upholstery trimming. Word play on “wool over my eyes.”\n      \n      &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Jail. The novel’s setting is a place full of violence, theft, and petty crimes. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Logical curiosity. Ilya’s working suggests that there is a link between residing in a city and falling into prison. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Large cities. Ilya is an itinerant knife-sharpener. The novel mostly takes place on the banks of the Itil (Volga) River, within a community of hunters, artisans, and invalids. Ilya has travelled and seen much. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Ilya’s search for his family (his son, Yakov, and his wife, Orina in various forms), however, will be a major plot point in the novel. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",

Гражданин Пожилых. \nЧеловек я для данных мест сравнительно посторонний, но поскольку точильщик, постольку точу ножи-ножницы, и с панталыку меня \nвряд ли, пожалуй, сбить, пусть я с первого взгляда и совершенный \nкультяп. Точу и косы, и топоры, и другой хозтовар, но такие подробности только усугубили бы речь. По реченной причине опускаю \nи события отзвонивших-и-с-колокольни-долой лет, лишь настаиваю, \nчто до сего дня вплоть в судимые не попал, даром что обитал в значительных городах. Куковал где поселят и запросто, за се́мью понастоящему не болел, а зарабатывал, прося у публики вспомоществовать по мере сил и возможностей. В чем и раскаиваюсь, избрав \nдля этого артель индивидов имени Д. Заточника. Вы меня извините, конечно, а контора самостоятельная, и прейскурант имеется налицо. В теплоту — все те же ножи: ходим вокруг да около и отходим \nв отхожие промысла́. Наоборот, в морозы обслуживаем население \nпо точке и клепке, поелику с ноября по апрель, ежедневно, без выходных, бобыльё и уроды наподобие Вашенского корреспондента \nзвенят и крутятся на зеркале вод, а как смеркнется — так Вы приветствуете их в трехэтажной тошниловке, прозванной с чьей-то заезжей руки кубарэ; но Илью среди них не обрящете. Вам взгрустнется: что он за мымра такой, почему не сообразит себе пару точеных, \nкак у людей, неужель презирает пошаркать на острых по гладкому, \nужели гребует кружечкой полезно-общественного пивка? Заблуждение, от свойственного ни в чем да не отрекусь, и не из тех я точильщиков, которые не востры суть. Пара, правда, нам ни к чему, но \nодин снегурок на блезире всегда висит. Что мне за важность, что \nочутился, к сожалению, ущерблен, ежели по натуре кремнист: полюбил раскатиться — и не уймешь, было б чем отпихнуться — дзынь \nразá, гражданин Пожилых, дзынь раза , и подъелдыкивай, брюзжи \nсебе под дугою хоть до Валдай-пристани — литье бубенчиков, печенье баранок, отпуск пеньки — и никто тебе по Итилю не указ. Разрешите продлить? А вот именно и оно, что отпихнуться в последнее \nвремя нечем как есть. Декабря в четвертый четверг, читай в Канун, \nшел я из-за реки, выдвигаясь от некоторого вряд ли Вам знакомого \nпогребальщика. Провожали одного одинокого, отбросившего коньки через собственный горделивый азарт. Жил он в Мыло — можно \nсказать — мукомолове, но на отшибе, в ужовниках с примесью ветляка, был охотник, держал неизменно бормотов, довольно-таки мохноногих, да сомневаюсь, чтоб состоял в переписке с кем-либо: сомнительно. Сам, однако, сновал сухощавый, как то мочало в жары́, \nа звали его — я не припомню как. Гурий — так и звали его, если на \nто пошло. Из развлечений означенного Гурия укажу на следующее: \nвот кто обожал пошаркать и раскатиться по гладкому на точеных, \nкоторые и стали причиной того, что мы клиента утратили, а погребальщики клиента же обрели. Рядом с этим поставлю в известность. \nВ стрелецкие числа, чтобы опасней, зато бодрей, бобыли обоих мелкоплесовских берегов обустраивают состязания на слабеющем льду. \nПроисходит в кромешной темени, предумышленно без небесных \nсветил, и народ фигуряет кто мудреней и суетится в горелки и взапуски, не зря промоин и трещин. Что чревовато. Прикурить насчет \nпокрутиться всем давал такой Николай, паренек из утильной, в конечном итоге, артели. По фамильярному прозванью Угодник, выступал он по́ миру как искренний незадачник, и отдельные шутники \nиз завистников ехидствовали над ним, говоря, что затейливо столь \nвыдрючивается оттого, что притерся мыкаться по темным углам, \nему, мол, в обычину. Хроника его невезухи, если не возражаете, какова? Он, во-первых, изведал семейную матату, но супруга поладила с волкобоем и сжила Угодника долой со двора, во-вторых. И тогда постучался в городнищенский приют для неслышащих, но последние дали от ворот поворот: учрежденье у нас лишь для глухарей, \nа ты, как видишь, еще и слепак, так что сам понимаешь. Потому этот \nмалый посунулся в незрячий приют: ничего подобного, переполнен \nлимит койко-мест, то ли случай, когда б фисгармоника собственная \nбыла, ошивался б по дебаркадерам и выручку знай сдавал бы в общий котел, и мы бы тебя за это держали. Угодников Николай, он \nвосстал перед ними во весь свой скрюченный рост и, сердито плача \nгорючими бельмами, закричал: стручки вы заморские, да случись \nу меня мусики́я своя — разве спрашивал бы я у вас, как же быть. \nИ следующим этапом явился не запылился в дом заезжих бездомных, но те вошли в его шкуру любезно, плеснув от души. И соблазняли: живи-ка, брат, вечно. А наведалась к кому-то из них эта дама \nи замечает Угодника среди прочих убогих, в кругу их: что это там \nу вас между вами невзрачный какой на катке? Не беспокойся, это \nпросто Николка у нас между нами катается себе на катке. Вероятно, \nне так уж худо его обстоятельство, говорит, если он лихо так оборачивается. Нет, сказали, оно у него не ахти, табак его обстоятельство, \nтолько и остается утех, что мысле́те выделывать. Дама же: нет уж, \nвы уж лучше не позволяйте ему здесь чудить, ну его, неказистого. \nИ богаделы просили Угодника: сделай нам одолжение, не живи-ка, \nбрат, вечно, а то нарекания. Ничего не ответил, ведь слыл ко всему \nи немым, и он отправился из заведения вдаль и даже не обернулся. \nИ его пригрела артель по сбору всевозможного утиля. Известили, \nчто излишней выслугой лет у них не блеснул, но что по пьяному \nделу маленько погорячился и куда-то такое пропал, да и вряд ли, \nпожалуй, объявится. Такова, если не возражаете, эта хроника. Возникает: точил ли я ему неточеные? А оказывается, только я один из \nвсего коллектива ему и точил, а остальные сотрудники, брезгуя, \nворотили нос, несмотря что и сами пачули не первой свежести. Точил я и Гурию, и Крылобылу, и Зимарь-Человеку точил, я всему \nИтилю, понимаете ли, точил. А вот Гурий-Охотник, он по беговой \nчасти карьеру жал. Хлебом, бывало, его не корми — дай разлететься \nпо скользкому. Разлетится он в артельную мастерскую некоторый \nраз, перепадет, словно бы долгожданный в засуху дождь, забежит, \nподустал, и что нам прикажете делать — мы сбрасываемся по рублю. И считаться. Вышел Гурий из тумана, вынул ножик из кармана, \nстану я тот нож точить, а тебе — вина тащить. Если мне — я с печалью, но я готов. Раз хотел уже приторочить к чеботу снегурок, но \nв это мгновение замечаю, что скучает по рашпилю. Хвать — а рашпиль запропастился совсем, либо коллеги его заиграли. Гурий задумался благородно и говорит: что ты ищешь, скажи. Я сказал. Он \nсказал им: эй вы, механики, верните стру́мент, кто заиграл, корешок \nобыскался а то. Но артель отвечала: отзынь, на́ болт нам долбаный \nрашпиль его. И еще: что он, на рашпиле, что ли, в Сло́боду попылит? \nДа и Вы, наверно, засомневаетесь, разумно ли, базируясь под боком \nу кубарэ, в Слободу семь верст киселя хлебать — на рашпиле там \nили на дурашпиле. Не сомневайтесь, ибо ведь жертва жребия спешит \nне пустой, он таранит в торбе на мощном горбу стеклотару, купно \nсобранную при долинах и взгорьях. И — Вы, может, еще совершенно \nне в курсе — стремлюсь предуведомить. В кубарэ из какой-то ложной гордыни посуду не принимают во вниманье отнюдь и навынос \nторгуют с большими скандалами, чем с человеческой точки дают \nкоммерческий мах. И другая картина рисуется в забегаловке на \nпротоке, за грядой кудреватых, но с виду незначительных островов. \nТам твое заберут по справедливой цене, без капризов, а оплаченное \nимеешь право употребить как в помещении, так и вне. И Гурий точильщикам напрямик: а хотя б и на рашпиле. И затем он же им же: \nИлье, вероятно, на рашпиле не с руки, ну, а я бы, разумеется, очаровательно б смог. Они его тогда — ну подначивать, гражданин Пожилых. \nВерим-верим, ты у нас марафонить известный мастак, вон мослы-то \nсебе отрастил — первый сорт, и сухие, и долгие, нам ли, с нашими \nбестолковыми моськами, в калашный ряд, а тем паче Илье-Безобразнику. Не сокрою, случаются фотокарточки хуже, но реже. Так, \nдокладывал егерь Манул, ходивший по щепетильным нуждам \nв Иные Места, что встречал там страшилищей и почище. Значит, не \nвсе потеряно, дорогой, и покуда держу я кой-как клепало и брус, \nк бесталанным себя не причислю, и отчаянья в Илье не ищи. Обнаруживаю я рашпиль, заусенец смахнул, и выдвигаюсь, груженый, на́ \nреку. Я беру направление наискосяк, под градусом, и поелику лед \nтонок, вся она подо мной как открытая. Достигаю протоки. По ней, \nв затишке наддав, заруливаю под самую Слободу. Тары-бары я там \nособенно не рассусоливаю, недосуг. Совершаю законную куплю-продажу, разворачиваюсь и дую вспять, а сумерки так и вьются над глупой моей башкой, и Даниилы мои издали светят мне штормовою \nкоптилкой, чтобы не проскочил я паче чаяния мимо цехов. Приняли мы тогда. Нас ты, горемык, обойдешь как стоячих, артель подначивала, с тобою, Гурий, гоняться мы пасы́. Так, механики, так, я меж \nвсеми тут есть настоящий сухой бегун. Поглядите, он им сказал, \nпоглядите во все наши дали заиндевелые, нет эдакого, которого бы \nя не обшаркал, — где юноша сей? Воскурили, заспорили и вышли на \nхолод перекурить. Стали мы на пригорке; за нами град деревянен, \nвелик, там мужик брандахлыстничает вовсю, а внизу, перед нами, \nплес — как на ладошке застыл. Оглянитесь, Гурий мастерам заявил, \nтам, на правой руке, будет у нас селение Малокулебяково. Ну и кто \nже у нас там живет? Мало ли в Кулебякове кто живет, артельщики \nсказали уклончиво. Например, существует там известный мельниктолстяк, которого земля едва носит, не то что лед, а на мельнице \nу мельника чурка числится, Аладдин, но с ним, понимаем, гоняться \nтебе не в честь. И находится в Кулебякове егерь еще, который, по \nслухам, в сухой колодец упал. Он кричит, а его не слышно, а супруга его знает, где он, но безынтересно ей его доставать, потому что \nс соседом фигли-мигли у ней — тоже егерем, но молодей: задурилтаки тот ей голову. Словом, заняты тут егеря, не до гонок. А больше \nв селе и нет никого. А во Плосках из более или менее бегунов обретается юноша Николай, у которого имени собственного не было \nникогда, верней, было, но слишком давно. И когда Николаю Угоднику вышло преображение и он улетел, этот имя его себе урвал — не \nдал, называется, добру пропасть. Гурий же: а то, что он рыбку потаскивает, — и вообще не беда и зря на него рыбари обижаются и желали бы погубить. Подумаешь — рыб человек у людей немножко \nкрадет, выискали тоже зацепку человека снедать. Так, Гурий, так, твари на воле, в тенетах ли — равно ничьи, а если и чьи — то известно \nЧьи, но тогда все ловцы здесь, выходит, сильнеющие браконьеры \nперед лицом Его. И напрасно, напрасно они Николу порешили некогда. Вот он, кстати сказать, улов их как раз из вентерей их подледных за островами берет. Завязал мешок — на салазки — и потянул. \nЗнобко ему, очи ему дальновидные метель нажгла, валенки прохудились, варежки потерял, коньки неточеные, а Волколис приставучий — он тут как тут. Кинь рыбешку, Николаю грозит, кинь вторую, \nа то темноту на Итиль напущу. Николая Плосковского ночь пуще \nсмерти страшит, и он тройку осетров Волколису беспрекословно \nкидает в лес. Ибо ведь в Городнище дотемна не поспеть — средств \nза товар не выручить, средств за товар не выручить — в кубарэ не \nзайти, в кубарэ не зайти — со товарищи не гулять, а со товарищи не \nгулять — так зачем тогда лямку тянуть, гражданин Пожилых, сами \nсудите. И пока те деятели с дрекольем веским Николая у околицы \nждут, он с полмешком осетров серебристых и зеленых склизких линей приближается ходом к пригородам. Мол, поклон тебе, лубяной \nвеселеющий град, исполать вам, высокие расписные тараканьи терема. Приюти, говорит, град, на грядущую ночь убиенного недругами невезучего рыбаря, закупи у него товар, дай деньжат небольших, \nчтоб в кармане позвякивало, пусть разгладятся морщины у старика, \nпусть растопырит нетопырь-одиночка сморщенные крылья свои. \nИ не будь скупердяем, плесни, град, вздрок. А еще, говорит, познакомь ты меня, град, с бобылкой которой-нибудь поскуластей, поласковей. Снял коньки и пошел, пошел в гору Николай из Плосков, \nа навстречу ему неимущих чертова прорва поспешает не торопясь: \nдай да дай нам от уловов твоих ради Христа, а не то хуже будет. Судари попрошаи, плесы у меня в мешке не мои, ибо все, что тут есть \nкругом, в том числе веретена рябых облаков, и река, и ладьи, что \nбрюхатыми вдовами валяются, брошены, кверху пузами возле бань, \nа также лохмотья наши и мы сами, которые в них, — все это не мое \nи не ваше. Знаем-знаем, нищие, как чумовые смеясь, закивали тогда, значит, дай нам тем не менее на́ душу по хвосту, дай нам рыб не \nтвоих, тем более. Вижу, горемыкам Николай плачется на горе, ви жу, \nчто на мякине не объегорить мне вас. И вручает каждому по линю. \nДеться некуда — нищих прорва, а он един. Человек одинокий в дороге его, особенно когда синька такая над Волчьей висит, он, позвольте признаться, на целом свете един. Николай дает им всякому \nпо хвосту и вступает с остатком добычи в деревянный декабрьский \nград, и стучит стародавней клюкой в ворота гулких дворов, и клянет шавок гавких, мерзлые цепи грызущих. А мы стоим себе дальше \nна берегу; звезд над нами немного пока воссияло, но все-таки. И Гурий-Охотник, он заявляет безо всяких обиняков: с Николаем \nПлосковским, пусть я его и уважаю слегка, гонки гонять для себя \nне полагаю приличным, по мне, он дряхл да и суетен — обшаркаю \nи смущу.\n\nНо не пощелкивает ли, сказал кто-то вдруг, не мудрует ли там, \nво Плосках, этот Федор, на счетах-то. То есть Федор не Федор, а как \nбы Петр. А уж Егор-то — во всяком случае. Специальность за ним \nчислилась счетовед, но и он, как впоследствии выяснилось, был вор \nхоть куда: вот бы с кем Гурию разбежаться. Понимаете ли, какая \nвещь? Когда эта дама явилась негаданно на косу, а они — большей \nчастью окрестные сидни из егерей — там сидели весной, как всегда, \nнаблюдая гусиный лет, но об этом сидении мало кто из посторонних \nосведомлен, так как происходящее имеет место в купинах и сумраках и плывущему по воде сокровенно, и когда они сидят на косе \nи слегка принимают, к ним является дама, интересуясь: ну что, нету \nли среди вас, которого я ищу? Да как тебе сказать, пожимают плечьми, смотри сама, только просим заметить, что мы все хоть куда и готовы на все про все, лишь бы потрафить тебе, приворотнице наших \nмест. Она стала смотреть сама и потом объявила: которого я ищу, \nсреди вас я не вижу, но замечаю иного, который бы мне на пока подошел. И посматривает на Петра. Лютый забрал счетоведа колотун, \nзасветился бухгалтер, как если бы пламень ясный по жилам у него \nполыхнул. И промолвил, подымаясь и отряхиваясь впопыхах. Он \nпромолвил, подымаясь с сырой земли, куда ему было уйти в скромном будущем: я — Егор из Плосков, и веди меня куда хочется. Увела его дама, счастливого, куда хочется, сидни же пили, закусывали \nи завидовали Петру. Дней через несколько возвращается на косу, \nи они обступили его и спрашивали. Что, Петра, сладенько выгорело \nтебе погулять? Сидни спрашивали Федора, чтобы узнать, сладко ли \nбыло с дамой ему. Он им почти ничего не высказал, но сказал им: \nмне было так, что лучше даже не спрашивайте. Ну а все-таки, не отступали от Федора волкари, все-таки — слаще ли браги тебе побывать у нее обломилось? Не спрашивайте, Петр отвечал, даже намеками. Слаще ли, чем крамбамбули, время минувшее было тебе, они \nвсе-таки спрашивали. Что там крамбамбули, Федор, вскипев, изумил, слаще гнилухи валдайской все выгорело. Приняли они тогда \nпо поводу возвращенья Петра, и он им с бухты-барахты признается \nв слезах, что возврата к зазнобе не мыслит, былое похерено, а поэтому не нужно ему ничего, ибо что ему лично нужно после всего, \nчто меж ними было двумя, да и воспоминания рассеянья не сулят; \nпамять не в дебет, брат, в кредит. И это факт, уж в этом-то, дорогой \nПожилых, положитесь-ка на меня, потерпевшего некогда крушение \nна скоростях. Не поперло тебе, Зынзырелла Илья, повело тебя, покоробило, будто фанерный лист. Кантовались мы в загороде, ютились вольготным браком у Орины в норе, позабыв про печали с печатями. Не клянусь, что по-гладкому катилась наша приязнь, но \nподчеркиваю — сначала обходилось втерпеж. Невтерпеж покатилось, когда со стрелки, где сортировала курьерские, скорые и тому \nподобные и где за недостатком дóсуга с шуры-мурами не особенното впротык, перебросили мою кралю в кирпичную башню, в диспетчера́ — вагоны с горки спускать. Не к добру ты мурлыкал, Илья, \nпредвкушая ее надбавку за чистоту, пел Отраду, живет, говорил, \nв терему, насвистывал, не чая крутых перемен. Лишь затем ты допетрил, что, гонимая узловатою скукотой, сопрягнулась со сцепщиками, стакнулась со ремонтным хамьем и что если и не было в башню \nхода кому — так только тебе, милок. А допетрив, первые сроки еще \nшутил: брось ты, Оря, мараться с ними по рвам некошеным, типа \nне истинное это у них, непутевые ведь ребята, путейцы-то. Так шутил, находя в себе смутные силы, пусть и не было мочи порой. Отбояривалась, ядреная, наливная, гребнем расчесываясь на заре: откуда знаешь, путевые или нет. Я же покуда в койке лежал и чадил, \nне желая подняться — к чему, мне некуда больше спешить. Отбояривалась, а пробы уже негде ставить на ней, и гребень — однажды \nя пригляделся — не тот, я который на Воздвиженье презентовал. \nСкопидомничал, унижался по дальним дворам, дабы приобрести, \nотказывал в необходимом себе листобой напролет, а пригляделся \nоднажды — другой. Я задумался. Прахом скукожилась наша приязнь, отвалить бы в бега — ни мешка, ни сумы, ни обуви. Но не здо́рово могуч, привязчивый: вместо этого вызнавал, уговаривал. Что \nэто, Орюшка, за гребень особенный такой у тебя? Гребень как гребень, сквозь зубы, шпильки-заколки зажав в зубах. Хм, а мой-то, даренный мною тебе, бережешь неужели же? Как же, как же, в музей \nснесла, ловко она осаживала меня своим языком. На путях, лукавит, утратила гребень тот, и вся недолга. Никнул я, словно флажками ошарашенный зверь, вызнавал, ударяясь в сомнения: хм, а этотто в таком разе с какого пятерика у тебя, подарил разве кто? А заря, замечаю вскользь, занимается и в окне, и в зеркале, отдавая \nв первостатейную переливчатую лазурь, и Орина, она прямо купается там, гибучая, плещется, точно в одном укромном пруду черт-те \nзнает которого лета, в июле примерно месяце. Между нами до близостей еще не дошло в те дни, все мудрила, отсрочивала — потом да \nпотом, и я ждал и терпел, обнадеженный. И плавали, набухая, две \nкабельных катушки пустых, как и во многом другом водоеме. Сбросила с себя все материи на ракитов куст и выступает на край вне \nзазрения. Ну и что же, а мне с башмачным шнуром заколдобило, \nзахлестнулась продернутая тесьма. Перервать бы — шалишь, категория попалась упористая. Короче, зубами я узел тот развязал: пребывали еще в наличии. И стояла Орина в одном лишь грошовом \nбисере, а цены ей самой-то не было, днем с огнем таких поискать. \nНе учел, сколько разных перепало мне до нее, но случайными радостями до искалеченья не был я обделен ничуть. Да те радости, право, — и смех и грех, все с ужимками, все колго́тятся, норовят дашь \nна дашь, продешевить опасаясь, будто я им, шикарам, действительно мог чего-нибудь предложить взамен, дурень стрюцкий. И главное, когда угомонишь наконец, то и тогда как-то все сикось-накось, \nскулемано, не вполне, да и нередко без настоящих удобств. А насчет \nпоказать себя уделить — никогда, ни за какие коврижки: миндальничают. Орину же осознал я вдруг во всей простоте, ну и восхитился, конечно же. Я не вытерпел и дал про это понять, спев куплет из \nодной распрекрасной арии. Идут тебе, дескать, любые цвета, но лучшее платье твое — нагота. Лучше б, однако, поменьше я перепелом \nбы влюбленным бил, а побольше бы дальше глядел; может, и углядел бы, кроме насущного узла на тесьме, узел грядый и другого немножечко сорта — где сортируют товарняки, узел, значит, чугунки, \nс различными его семафорами и хитрыми штучками-дрючками вроде смазчикских крючьев и смазчиков самих по себе, ловко без мыла \nлезущих куда не след. Тот-то узел мне — благо сполохи полыхали — \nразвязать повезло, а с сортировочным — пусть там все ночи, полные \nогня, — грянула неразбериха, не постижимая никакому уму. Но пока, \nповторяю, стояла Орина бела да ясна, словно шашка в сияньи месяца. Если честно, то в целом терпелось, но мне не терпелось, я помню, скорее узнать, что там было у нее, да с кем, да когда, то есть \nвыведать ее подноготную. Недостаточно тебе, блудливый Илья, просто женщину охмурить и принудить, ты ведь, как паук неуемный, \nвытягиваешь из нее по капле признаний настой, силу жалости в нем \nберя, чтобы вновь приступить и принудить. Постояла Орина над \nсамым прудом и вошла, и я, разоблачившись, нырнул. Я нырнул \nглубоко, разомкнув мои вежды; смотрю — обливная глазурь. Глазом \nмира был этот пруд с катушками, опалом шлифованным в оправе \nглин синих, купин ивы и тин длинных был он. А караси-то где тут \nу нас, мне взбрело вдруг. Прищурился — дремали в ямах, в тени берегов, под корягами. А улитки, то бишь ракушки двустворчатые? \nЯ люблю их. Скитаясь по долгу службы с одинокой гармоникой \nили с точильным ножным станком, странствуя в долине ненаглядной Итиль-реки, задрипан и собственному сердцу обрыдл, я последних едал без меры. Да хороши ли на вкус? Видите ли, за похвалою \nне постою: объядение. В местности глухой, где спасается древнеющий люд-глухарь, которому вся твоя филармония вне надобности; \nили в области тупой, где никто ничего не сечет, не режет, не рубит \nиз-за лени повальной; в местности тупой и в области глухой к исходу напрасно изжитого света, когда людям играл, а они не вняли, \nиль домогался, поточить ли не требуется то да се, дабы иметь на пропитание с них, но не вынесли ни малой даже иглы, разузнай у старого коромысла дорогу к воде и канай, пустобрюхий, к ней в гости, \nчто к теще на званый борщ. Ты хромай большаками на единосущной ноге, ковыляй заливными лузя́ми, осененный блестким узорочьем. Что такое, что это, словно бы засветилось там тускловато так, \nсловно бы тля блудящая на кладбище Быдогощ? Что засквозило в чапыжниках серебром наподобие как бы того, как сквозит алюминиевый котелок твой недраенный в прорехах нештопаной сумы \nтвоей? Что это там полыхнуло кубовым холодным огнем, будто бы \nиз-под купецкой полы на базаре сосуд гусь-хрустальный с сиволдаем бесценным в очи твои суховатые полыхнул? Что это там развевается впереди сарафанной рюшью, плещется тещиным языком? \nЧто да что, ишь — чевокалка какой выискался, беда мне с тобой. \nВолчья река это, паря, твоя родня. Ты скажи ей: ау, старша́я, напои \nменя огорченного текучей собой, накорми перехожего своими ракушками, мне их побольше дай, они приятны на вкус. Их предоставь \nлишь, а соль и спички имею с собой всегда, ну и спать, разумеется, \nуложи вдоль течения, камышек под затылок помягче сунь. И она \nговорит: для тебя мне, Илюша из Городнищ, ничего, если разобраться, не жаль; например, воды — хоть залейся; и такое же положенье \nс ракушками — кушай и не считай. А камышек — хочешь под голову, \nхочешь — на шею дам, отдыхай тогда на здоровье хоть до Страшнеющего Суда.\n\n\n  \n    \n      This expression hides a double meaning, as the word “mesiats” may mean both “moon” and “month”. The author is at once suggesting that “the month is clear” (a rather indeterminate time setting) and that “the moon shines”. Данное выражение скрывает в себя по крайней мере два значения: подразумевается либо месяц календаря, либо фаза луны. В первом случае это довольно неопределенное указание на время года, а во втором случае описывается, как луна сияет на небе.Formulation recalls Nikolai Gogol’s “Diary of a Madman” (1834): “I don’t remember the date. There was also no month” (Ostanin 10). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Typical sample of Sokolov’s non-linear conception of time (see, for instance, R.C. Borden, Time, backward!: Sasha Sokolov and Valentin Kataev, in CASS 21 (3-4) 1987, 247-263; School for fools, Palisandriya) Классический пример нелинеарного восприятия времени (см., например, с критической точки зрения, R.C. Borden, Time, backward!: Sasha Sokolov and Valentin Kataev, in CASS 21 (3-4) 1987, 247-263, и Школа для дураков / Палисандрия) &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      This expression introduces the reader into a blurred atmosphere of uncertainty, where exact coordinates in space and time are deliberately foggy. Данное выражение вводит читателя в мутную атмосферу неопределенности: пространственно-временные представления являются нарочито туманными. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Interestingly enough, Sokolov avoids using the most common Soviet appellative “Tovarishch” opting for a rather general, but still evocative word (think of Nikolay Nekrasov’s “Poet i grazhdanin,” Poet and Citizen, 1856). Интересно заметить, что Соколов избегает употреблять советское слово “товарищ”, предпочитая ему более общий, зато значимый термин “гражданин” (ср. “Поэт и гражданин” Николая Некрасова, 1856).I can be wrong, but I think this is also related to the epistolary genre Ilya is here trying to reproduce and to the fact that his world is rather the ‘old’ one than the soviet one Наверное это тоже зависит оттого, что Илья хочет “правильно” писать заявление и думает выражениями, типичными для “старого” (несоветского или, лучше, досоветского) времени &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Sidor (shortened form of Isidor), son of Foma. Here the declension of the name is incorrect (should be in the dative case, Sidoru). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      An unusual surname, which does not permit standard declination. It literally means Elderly. Необычная, несклоняемая фамилия.Boris Ostanin suggests a connection to Boris Pasternak’s novel Doctor Zhivago by means of the root “zhiv” (to live) (Ostanin, 10). Likewise, he notes, too, that Alexander Pushkin considered including a story entitled “Notes of an Elderly Person” in his cycle of short stories, The Tales of Belkin. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Again an usual last name (which is printed in more than ten different versions in the book). It carries allusions to Cinderella (see L. Toker’s essay,”Gamesman’s Sketches (Found in a Bottle),” CASS 21.3-4: 356). Еще одна необычная фамилия (которая встречается и в других графических-орфографических вариантов дальше в тексте). Намекается на сказку Золушки (по-английски Cinderella; cм. L. Toker,”Gamesman’s Sketches (Found in a Bottle),” CASS 21.3-4: 356).–&gt; unusual &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      (add bibliography and sum up main interpretations) &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      (add bibliography and sum up main interpretations) &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      It echoes the Zadonschina, a Russian manuscript of late 14th century about the Battle of Kulikovo (1380). In this way the story Ilya is telling to Mr Pozhilych becomes a real epic poem. Слово построенное по образу памятника древнерусской литературы Задонщина, о Куликовской битве. Таким образом, история, рассказана Ильёй, становится настоящей эпопеейB. Ostanin also suggests a sound link between the rivers Itil’ and Lethe (Leta) (p. 10).The title that Ilya gives to his missive to Pozhilykh. Its name echoes that of the Zadonschina, a Russian manuscript of late 14th century, about the Battle of Kulikovo (1380) between Russians and Mongols. The contents of Ilya’s letters concern the events related to his life and death that occur “beyond the Itil River.” In this way, the story Ilya tells Pozhilykh becomes a real epic poem. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",

  content: "To live; to know the value of deep galoshes at the time \nof flooding of the deep and shallow rivers. To be; to \nsoil the dark-green leaf. To live, to be, and to see how \nin ditches the waybread wilts. To live and to be—in step with \nthe meandering of winter, may the hue of its micalike scaly \nwings change. To live and to be—may they iridesce like mother-of-pearl: any icicle, any membrane. May Maria trumpet on a \nshepherd’s horn at the railroad, and may the latter hurry northward fifteen minutes of slow walk toward the sunset. A walk \nalong the alley, positioned perpendicularly to the ramp—to \nthe sunrise. And on the southerizon, above the city, as a result \nof sizable smoldering installations that mangle the skyline, may \nthere always be a selection of barbecued and smoked clouds. \nTo draw the distant silhouettes of the post office employees—letter carriers, gripped by anguish and the leaf fall. May your \npeople wander around your park, and may your inclement \nweathers come, chilling them to the bone and causing the folds \nof their consignment-store coats to flap. May Maria work in the \ntall brick tower at the very edge of the station. May she work and \nmay the voice of her horn, smudged by the watercolor wind, \nsmudged like a star of someone nearsighted without glasses, \ncommand the fussy scurrying of the couplers, anxieties of the \nsignalwomen, and the mood of the rail guardsmen. At first \nthey were gold-toothed couplers, but later, when she was \nnamed the head of the tower, they were gradually replaced by \nstately engineers. May the long-distance veteran come, complaining in half whisper, with a lisp, about the shattered tender, \nshaky shafts, and the expanses of its long-distancedness. May \nthe trees, donning the tattered tailcoats of the dusk, swing, \nwave their hands like the conductors, scarecrows, and windmen-millers. The blizzard, still confused by many with the lizard, which, even with a “b” it so resembled, although a special \ndecree not only had determined long before their differences, \nbut also assigned the not appropriate and not needed by the \nlizard “z” to the blizzard—the blizzard kept gathering speed, \nkept acting out, becoming relentless and merciless. In the barracks people were having fun. Ah, how my head is spinning, \nsang in rooms a reprehensibly empty-headed chansonnette, \nand her round photos, glued to the records, spun around, stuck \non gramophone figs. To draw from memory the bottom of the \nravine, overgrown with ferns, and the dam holding the reservoir of drinking waters; to draw the entire reservoir, crammed \nwith the props of all possible regattas in the season of watermelons and drizzling precipitations, shaped like little circles \nand sticks, and the sailor-reader, who, at the whim of the artist, \nmay sit on the stone slope of the dam, having raised up the \ncollar of his pea jacket, smoke his pipe, and read a navy-colored \nbook—about the sea. Have a drink and a chaser. And she herself drank and had a chaser. They called her Maria. The engineer \ndrank, had a chaser, called her Marina, and chewed over the \nsame rail and road gloom, treading water from Orekhovo to \nZuevo. The bearings kept cracking, the axle boxes kept heating \nup, the manometer readings were announced, and before every bridge, before every tunnel, unfailingly, the damper was \nclosed and the siphon was opened. To draw a passenger station: a dilapidated pavilion with a cone-shaped false turret and \na beer stand with a stream of dark coats and green hats; to draw \nthe remnants of a monastery wall, the viaduct with a section of \nthe highway, and the pond at the foot of a high embankment. \nAt the neighbors’ raved an Italian concertina, and a habanera, a \npolka, or a quadrille pounded the crumbling joists. May the \nhubbub steamily tumble out through the opened window \nvents and as pastel-hued rags—washed-out and full of holes—may it hang on clotheslines and after a while, blown off by the \nwind, disperse over the park as flocks of jackdaws and crows, \nalight on the branches, swarm, ethereal and aloof, and later, \nwith the husks of silence, with its clots, fall down on the alleys. \nMay the gusts of the ground wind brush its remnants into the \nravine, into the dark blue haze of the river torrent. I love you, \nmy old park, confessed the artist, flipped upside down, completely worn out and listless, under the stairs, in the truncated \nstoreroom of the carton master who, in his spare time, collected candy wrappers. To draw the heavy, nebulous, slovenly \nface of Maria and frequently, instead of the expected portrait, \nmay the inexperienced draftsman create the image of her mask, \nas it were; and the mask wanted to wake up, to come to life, but \nits tormenting lethargic debility turned out to be stronger than \nits feeble wishes—it did not wake up. But he saw, he saw—on \nher meaty lips and droopy-lead lids flickered the flashes of \nmystery. It will be revealed after midnight, when through sleep \nyou will hear how, outside, the rain engineer will start raving in \na whisper and the entire earth, Masha, drunk, poisoned by the \ntincture of autumn, will dolorously submit to him, accepting \nhis pushy minuscule seed. Later, may her anthropomorphous \nshadow wander across the wall, searching for the rattler of \nmatches and for engineer’s cigarettes. Kazbek or Kazbich? In \nany case, even if he had a herd of a thousand mares, he would \nhave given it all away for one Azamat. But if the girl who went \nout with that ship’s boy to that meadow, where the sailors take \ntheir merry girlfriends to play on swings, if she agreed to go \nthere also with you, she would probably fly and squeal in a high \nvoice with you too. You stood in the darkness of the forest, unseen. It was neither evening nor day, and at the reservoir the \nsails were still present and the trainers on motorboats kept \ncroaking commands for rowers into bullhorns. She squealed \nlike lapwings in the field, when you walk across in semidarkness, having set the traps for foxes and cherishing in advance \nthe real rifle, promised by the engineer. Or when the ship’s boy \nhas led her by hand to the abandoned slips, and the lapwings \nhave been flying about, and the slips are filthy, and the rain and \ntime cannot catch up with washing them off, and now and then \na dead rat, a stiff toad, or a lifeless shrike. May Maria howl, running out on the dam, calling “Come home,” while the light-carrier wind—may it blow in the darkness and extinguish for \ngood the windows of the barracks, eye after eye, one after another. May the waves get bolder. The other ship’s boy, a veritable chimney from the early youthful years, groaning with the \nsaddle like an old man, buzzing with the dynamo and flashing \nwith the headlamp, may cough by on two wheels in the direction of the expiration of the furlough. Maria was sewing. What \nwas Masha sewing? Masha was mending the engineer’s coat. \nThe engineer was happy. He sat on the couch and read the train \nschedule. Or the timetable. The blizzard was approaching. In \nthe thickets of tubular fragile plants, with the open fractures \nsmelling like the first frosts, in the thickets next to the muddy \nstream, croakers prophesied the universal flood. There, in the \nravine, once—her notebook: a half-washed-out name. It contained sufferings in the Russian language. In particular, it reported that Papa bought skates for Nikolay, that a squirrel \ngnaws nuts, that granddaughter is young and grandmother \nvice versa, that sister is playing piano and brother bala—but \ninstead of balalaika, to the middle of the notebook stretched a \nsolid, uninterrupted balabala, a bolero of the pimply barrack \nlife, overheard and written down by the true love of the youngster with an anemic forehead of an artist neither called nor recognized who, years later, answering the reproaches of a special \ncommission that up until now he has not presented to its attention a reasonable account of the hunting roundup, more precisely, of the circumstances accompanying the return of the \nhunters from the roundup, being, in essence, the necessary attributes of the return—since are the circumstances not determining and stipulating the entire development and appearance \nof the phenomenon, is it not alive thanks to them, and what is \nthe phenomenon without accompanying circumstances— \nanswering the reproaches of the commission, he may reply: \nI do not perceive sufficient reasons, for the sake of which my \nimpressions about such trivialities would be able to substantially help in the inspection’s work; therefore I would truly prefer to keep them exclusively to myself. However, if You so \ninsist—please. We are returning at dusk. You, I suppose, are \nalready acquainted with each other or, more precisely, with \nthis wonderful time of the day and are irrevocably enchanted \nby it, like I am, and thus reveal remarkable taste, exceptional \nfeel for the color, and an inclination for melancholic contemplation. There are, as a rule, several of us—huntsmen and up to \na dozen dogs in the pack. It is December. In order not to attract \nthe gawkers and not to lower the quality of the picture by my \nawkward, still-city-like gait, I am trying to stay at the end of the \nprocession; therefore, I see neither the faces nor the muzzles; \nonly someone’s profile flashes momentarily. Gray hats of the \nhunters—You are probably familiar with this heavy and firm but \nalso fuzzy felt of our provincial factories, to which snow sticks \nin lumps with such a remarkable tenacity, whether it falls on \nthe headgear or the headgear falls into a snowdrift—the gray \nhats of the hunters are pulled low, over their ears, as the saying \ngoes, and that is why one can not see their napes, either. One of \nus, in addition to the usual equipment—a dagger, a game bag, \nand a spear—is burdened by our shared trophy: The fox had \nbeen slain already at dawn. By the way, take a good look at our \nmongrels and abortzois. Horrendously long, ugly, curved monkey-like and resembling Filippov pretzels, do their tails leave at \nleast a flicker of hope for pure blood? It is no secret—pitiful is \nthe exterior of my hounds: skin and bones, and completely \nmatted coats. By the way, there is among them one bloated, \nwobbly, with a hideously short snout—a spook matching the \npiglet that some simple folk roast over the bonfire in front of \nthe tavern entrance, where, having assured us they would catch \nup soon, some huntsmen dropped in to wait out a very strong \ngust of headwind. Is there any need to mention that right now \nwe are on the summit of a large hill, condemned, like the entire \nsite, to the fresh Christmas snow, and our figures contrast quite \nwell with this background? After leaving the tavern on the left, \nwe have almost passed it and begin to descend into the valley. \nIn front of us stretches a perennially familiar panorama. This is \nthe dale of the river, and a town in this dale next to this river, \nand ponds, and barns in the distance, and the sky above everything listed. This is our country; we live here, and while some \nof us live in town, the others live in the village, beyond the emerald river. We easily distinguish the dike and the mill, the \nchurch and the horse carts on the roads, the library, the hospice, and the bathhouse. We see the steep roof of the invalids’ \nhome, the grinding establishment, the shelter for the deaf, and \nthe market. And a mass of skaters on the ice of the river and the \nponds. Their voices and skates sound resonant, their faces are \nflushed. Here—brownish clumps of leafless trees, resembling \nthe fur of unknown animals; there—washerwomen, rinsing the \nlinen in an ice hole. In addition, boats frozen into ice, and levees, \nand birds—oh, a mass of birds both on the branches and simply \nin the celery-smelling space—firebirds, faded, discolored, or \nhaving completely replaced their whimsical garb with the modest feathers of magpies and crows. What a marvelous country, \nout of this world, a visitor halts in admiration. The simplicity \nand modesty of the walnut frame only enhances the enchanting \nbeauty of the landscape and the excellence of the color glazing. \nOf course, our sketch does not pretend to describe and evaluate all the other pictures exhibited at the vernissage: We will \nonly stop for a moment next to some of them. Self-Portrait in \nUniform. The canvas is to such a degree distinctive that one \nsimply has to be amazed. It has been said that having finished \nthe work, its author was literally shaken by the depth of his \nself-perception; success caught the artist completely unawares. \nHaving unsociably locked himself in his atelier, located at that \ntime in the orangery, he, after getting somnambulistically lost \namong photinias with tiny blooms and mannequins indifferent to everything, and repeating ceaselessly “I do not believe it, \nI do not believe it,” stubbornly refuses to believe that it is not \nhim there, in the corner, leaning over the easel, but only his \nimage, even if it is extraordinarily similar to the original. And \nwhen his relatives, assisted by the gardener and the cutter, having broken the door, finally convinced the master in his own \noriginality—he burst into tears. The color reproduction of \nSelf-Portrait in Uniform will adorn the frontispiece of our \nmonograph about this remarkable man; its publication is eagerly anticipated day in and day out. And how significant is the \nfact that the appearance of one of the subtlest, most refined \nrealists of the recent past coincided with such a remarkable \ndate as the five-hundredth anniversary of the pin. The artist \nhimself thought that the mentioned coincidence was far from \naccidental and emphasized this on every appropriate occasion, \nseeing in it either the gesture of Providence or the digit of Mnemosyne. Say, in one of his poems, the painter, with his characteristic candor, announces: Well, gentlemen, in the year from \nthe invention of the pin 541, on the last Friday of November, \napproximately at six o’clock, at a considerable distance from \nany capitals, in the middle of Russia, and at the same time on \nthe shore of a deep and wide river, someone is drunkenly beating the tambourine. The dusk has already forced the eyes to \nopen wide, obscured the vistas, and abolished all traces of \nlight. The silhouette of the musician is about to dissolve. For \nthat reason, groaning and tripping over the folds of the Amztarakhan robe that gives an impression of being completely \nfrayed, suffering from the chill emanating from the mossy \nstones of the cellar, shuddering from disgust at the sight of \nmultiple millipedes, and begging the hiccups to move over to \nthe submissive passion-bearers Fedot and Yakov, let us roll out \ninto God’s world the barrel of the narrative—and let us finally \nknock out the bung. That is how, gazing through a small window during a relatively late hour of one of the pitiful days of \nanother inclement year and trying to gather his thoughts, the \nhero of this story philosophized. Vita sine libertate nihil, he philosophized, vivere est militare. He was not fresh and not young.\n",

  content: "Жить; знать цену глубоким галошам в пору разлива глубоких \nи мелких рек. Быть; мусолить жирно-зеленый лист. Жить, быть и видеть, как по канавам жухнет лопух. Жить-быть; по мере змеенья зимы меняться оттенкам ее слюдяных чешуйчатых крыльев. Житьбыть — пускай переливаются перламутрово: любая сосулька, любое \nперепело́. Марии — трубить в пастуший рожок на железной дороге, \nа той — торопиться на север в пятнадцати минутах спокойной ходьбы на закат. Ходьбы по аллее, восставленной перпендикуляром к насыпи — на восход. На юго-склоне ж, над городом, вследствие значительных дымочадных, коверкающих горизонт, работ всегда иметься \nв наличии выбору вяленых и копченых туч. Рисовать отдаленные \nсилуэты сотрудников почт — почтальонов, охваченные отчаянием \nи листопадом. Людям твоим — блуждать в парке твоем, а ненастьям \nтвоим наступать, леденя их и раздувая полы их комиссионных крылаток. Марии — служить в высокой кирпичной башне, у самой границы станции. Служить, и голосу рожка ее, смазанному акварельным ветром, смазанному, словно звезда близорукого без очков, — \nзаведовать суетливой юркостью сцепщиков, тревогами стрелочниц, \nнастроеньем стрелков. То были сначала фиксатые сцепщики, но позже, когда ее назначили главной в башне, их постепенно вытеснили \nстепенные машинисты. Приходить ветерану дальнего следования, \nполушепотом, шепеляво жалующемуся на прохудившийся тендер, \nна расшатавшиеся шатуны, на дальность маршрутов следования. \nДеревьям, напялившим драные фраки сумерек — качаться, махать \nруками в подражание дирижерам, пугалам и людям от ветряков — \nмукомолам. Метель, о ком многие думали еще через я, тогда как \nособым указом его давно передали Зайцу, на кого и безухое оно \nстоль походило, а несвойственное и ненужное Зайцу е передали метели, — она расходилась, разыгрывалась, делаясь неугомонной и неумолимой. В бараках гуляли. Ах, как кружи́тся голова, пела в комнатах предосудительно ветреная шансонетка, и круглые фото ее, \nнаклеенные на пластинки, вертелись, насаженные на патефонные \nкукиши. Рисовать по памяти дно оврага, поросшее папоротниками, \nдамбу, подпирающую хранилище питьевых вод, рисовать все хранилище, загроможденное реквизитом всевозможных регат в сезон арбузов и моросящих осадков в виде кружочков и палочек, и матросачитателя, что по капризу художника пусть сидит, поставив торчком \nворотник бушлата, на каменистом откосе дамбы, курит трубку и читает синюю книжку — про море. Пейте и закусывайте. И сама пила \nи закусывала. Звали Марией. Машинист пил, закусывал, звал Мариной и пережевывал то же самое — дорожное, железное, скучное, \nпереливая из Орехова в Зуево. Постоянно летели подшипники, горели буксы, сообщались показания манометра, и перед каждым мостом, перед каждым тоннелем неукоснительно захлопывалось поддувало и открывался сифон. Рисовать пассажирскую станцию: облупленный павильон с конусовидной фальшивой башенкой, пивной \nларек с чередою темных плащей и зеленых шляп, рисовать остатки \nмонастырской стены, виадук и участок шоссе и пруд у подножья \nвысокой насыпи. У соседей наяривала тальянка, и венгерка ли, полька ли, то ли кадриль лупцевала трухлявые перекрытия. Гвалту — \nвываливаться распаренно в отверстые фортки и тряпьем пастельных \nтонов — застиранным и дырявым — повисать на бельевых веревках, \nа после, сдутому ветром, разлетаться по парку стаями галок, ворон, \nрассаживаться по ветвям, гомозиться — несусветному, отчужденному, и выжимками тишины, ее сгустками, падать потом в аллеи. Поземке — сметать его останки в овраг, в синюю муть стремнины. \nЯ люблю тебя, мой старый парк, перевернутая на другую сторону, \nсовершенно заезженная и томная, признавалась артистка под лестницей, в усеченном чулане картонажного мастера, собиравшего к тому \nже фантики от конфет. Рисовать тяжелый, невнятный и неряшливый лик Марии и нередко вместо желаемого портрета неопытному \nрисовальщику — получать изображение как бы ее маски, и маска \nхотела проснуться, ожить, но мучительное летаргическое бессилие \nоказывалось сильнее вялых ее желаний — не просыпалась. Но видел, видел — по мясистым губам, по налитым оловянным векам скользили зарницы тайного. Станет явным за полночь, когда сквозь сон \nуслышишь, как во дворе шепотом забредит дождь-машинист и вся \nземля, опьяненная, отравленная настоем осени Маша, горестно покорится ему, приемля его настырное мелкое семя. Позже человекообразной тени ее бродить по стене в поисках погремка спичек и папирос машиниста. Казбек или Казбич? Во всяком случае, если бы \nу него был табун в тысячу кобылиц, то отдал бы его весь за одного \nАзамата. Но если бы та девочка, что ходила с тем юнгой на ту поляну, куда матросы водят качать на качелях веселых подруг, если бы \nона согласилась пойти туда и с тобой, то и с тобой высоко на качелях она бы, наверное, подлетала и взвизгивала бы высоко. Ты стоял \nв чернолесье, незримый. Был ни вечер, ни свет, а на хранилище \nеще — паруса, и тренеры на моторках хрипели в рупоры приказы \nгребцам. Взвизгивала, словно чибисы в поле, когда идешь в полумраке через, расставив капканы на лис, дорожа настоящим, обещанным машинистом ружьем. Или когда юнга вел ее под руку к заброшенным стапелям, а чибисы летали, а стапеля загажены, а дожди \nи время не успевают смывать, и время от времени — то дохлая крыса, то палая жаба, то мертвый сорокопут. Марии — выть, выбегая на \nдамбу, зовя домой, а ветру-фонарщику — задуть в темноте и задуть \nокончательно окна бараков: око за оком, одно за одним. Волнам — \nвзбодриться. Другому юнге, табакуру с молодых-юных лет, по-стариковски кряхтя седлом, жужжа динамо-машиной и фарой светя, \nпрокашлять мимо на двух колесах в сторону истечения увольнительных сроков. Мария шила. Шила Мария. Маша ушивала машинисту \nшинель. Машинист был рад. Он сидел на тахте и читал расписание \nдвижения поездов. Или график. Гроза приближалась. В зарослях \nтрубчатых хрупких растений, чьи открытые переломы пахнут первыми заморозками, в зарослях у гнилого ручья квакши пророчили \nвселенский потоп. Там, в овраге, однажды — ее тетрадь: полуразмытое имя. Содержала страдания по русскому языку. В частности сообщалось, что папа купил Николаю коньки, что белка грызет орехи, \nчто внучка молодая, а бабушка наоборот, что сестра играет на пианино, а брат на бала — но вместо балалайки до середины тетради \nтянулось сплошное, непрерывное балабала — болеро прыщеватой \nбарачной жизни, подслушанное и записанное возлюбленной отрока \nс малокровным челом незваного и непризнанного художника, кому \nгоды спустя на упреки особой комиссии, что им до сих пор не предложен ее вниманию удобоваримый отчет об охотах в облаву, точнее — об обстоятельствах, сопутствующих возвращению охоты с облав и, по сути, являющихся непременными атрибутами возвращения — ибо не обстоятельства ли определяют и обуславливают весь \nход и облик явления, не ими ли живо оно, и что есть явление без \nсопутствующих обстоятельств, — на упреки комиссии возражать: \nне усматриваю действительных оснований, в силу коих мои впечатления о такой заурядице способны были бы реальным образом \nстать полезными в работе инспекции, отчего и желал бы оставить их \nисключительно при себе. Впрочем, если вы́ так настаиваете — извольте. Мы возвращаемся в сумерках. Вы, полагаю, уже представлены \nили, точнее, имеете представление об этом замечательном часе суток \nи бесповоротно очарованы им, мне подобно, обнаруживая таким образом недюжинный вкус, превосходное чувство цвета и склонность \nк меланхолической созерцательности. Нас, как правило, несколько \nзверобоев и до дюжины своры. Декабрь. Чтобы не кидаться в глаза \nротозеям и не снижать картины своею неловкой, все еще городскою \nпоходкою, я стараюсь держаться в конце процессии, почему и не \nвижу ни лиц, ни морд; только чей-нибудь профиль мелькнет на миг. \nСерые шляпы охотников — вы, верно, знаете этот тяжелый и плотный, но и ворсистый фетр наших провинциальных фабрик, на котором, сбиваясь в комки, так изумительно цепко удерживается снег, \nвсе равно — он ли падает на головной убор, или убор — в сугроб; \nсерые шляпы охотников нахлобучены низко, что называется по \nуши, посему не усматриваешь и затылков. Один из нас, помимо обычных доспехов — кинжала, ягдташа, копья, — обременен общим нашим \nтрофеем: лис затравлен был еще на заре. Полюбуйтесь-ка, кстати, \nна наших ублюдков и выборзков. Пугающе длинные, гадкие, закрученные по-обезьяньи, будто филипповские кренделя, оставляют ли \nих хвосты хоть призрачную надежду на благородство кровей. Что \nутаивать — жалок экстерьер моих гончаков: кожа да кости, и шерсть \nсовершенно свалялась. Впрочем, есть одна пухловатая, рахитичная, \nс безобразно коротким щипцом — кикимора под стать тому поросенку, которого какие-то простолюдины палят над костром перед \nвходом в таверну, куда, уверив, что вскорости нас догонят, наведались переждать очень сильный порыв лобового ветра некоторые \nстрелки. Стоит ли говорить о том, что теперь мы находимся на перевале большого холма, обреченного, как и вся местность, рождественскому свежему снегу и наши фигуры недурно контрастируют \nс этим фоном. Оставив таверну слева, мы почти миновали ее и начинаем спускаться в долину. Перед нами — давно знакомая панорама. Это — долина реки и город в этой долине при этой реке, и пруды, и скалы вдали, и небо надо всем перечисленным. Это наш край, \nмы живем здесь, и если одни из нас живут в городе, то другие — \nв деревне, за изумрудной рекой. Мы легко различаем плотину и мельницу, церковь и возы на улицах, библиотеку, и богадельню, и баню. \nВидим острую крышу инвалидного дома, точильное заведение, приют глухих и базар. А на льду прудов и реки — масса катающихся. \nЗво́нки их голоса и коньки, разгоряченны лица. Там — буроватые, напоминающие мех неведомых зверей купины оголенных дерев; сям — прачки, полощущие белье в проруби. Есть еще вмерзшие \nв лед ладьи, и запруды, и птицы — о, масса птиц — и на ветках, \nи просто в пространстве, пахнущем сельдереем, — жароптицы, полинялые, выцветшие или вовсе сменившие свой прихотливый наряд на скромное оперенье сорок и ворон. Что за чудесная, неотмирная такая страна, в восхищении застывает посетитель. Простота \nи неброскость ореховой рамы лишь подчеркивает очаровательную \nпрелесть пейзажа и колористический блеск лессировки. Очерк наш, \nразумеется, не претендует на описание и оценку всех остальных, \nвыставленных на вернисаже картин: мы остановимся лишь у некоторых. Автопортрет в мундире. Полотно настолько своеобразное — \nпросто диву даешься. Рассказывают, что, завершив работу, автор \nбыл прямо-таки потрясен глубиною своего самопроникновения; \nуспех застает художника в совершенный расплох. Нелюдимо замкнувшись в ателье, располагавшемся тогда в оранжерее, он, сомнамбулически потерявшись меж мелко цветущих фотиний и безразличных ко всему манекенов и все повторяя — не верю, не верю, — \nупорно отказывается верить, что это не он там, в углу, прислонился \nк мольберту, а всего лишь изображение его, пусть и невероятно \nсходное с оригиналом. А когда близкие, с помощью садовника и закройщика высадив дверь, наконец убедили его в его собственной \nоригинальности — разрыдался. Цветная репродукция Автопортрета в мундире украсит фронтиспис нашей монографии об этом выдающемся человеке, выход которой в свет с нетерпением ожидается \nизо дня в день. А как знаменательно, что появление на свет одного \nиз тончайших, изощреннейших реалистов последнего времени совпало с такой замечательной датой, как пятисотлетье булавки. Сам \nартист полагал, что упомянутое совпадение отнюдь не случайно, \nи при всяком удобном случае подчеркивал его факт, усматривая \nв нем то жест Провидения, то перст Мнемозины. Скажем, в одном \nиз стихотворений живописец с присущей ему прямотой объявляет: \nмол, господа, в Лето от изобретения булавки пятьсот сорок первое, \nв последнюю пятницу ноября, часу примерно в шестом, в значительном удалении от каких бы то ни было столиц, посреди России, \nа вместе с тем — на берегу полноводной реки, некто нетрезво бьет \nв бубен. Сумерки уже растаращили очи, затушевали перспективы \nи упразднили згу. Силуэт музыканта вот-вот растворится. Посему, \nкряхтя и путаясь в полах амзтараханского, отзывающегося полнейшей ветошью халата, страдая от холода, источаемого замшелыми \nкаменьями погреба, содрогаясь от омерзения при виде многочисленных многоножек и увещевая икоту перейти на безропотных страстотерпцев Федота и Якова, выкатим на свет Божий бочку повествования — и выбьем наконец затычку. Так, уставясь в окошко в сравнительно поздний час одного из ничтожных дней очередного \nпромозглого года и пытаясь собраться с мыслями, философствовал \nгерой этой повести. Вита синэ либертатэ нихиль, философствовал \nон, виверэ эст милитарэ. Он был несвеж и немолод.\n",

  content: "Note I\n\nImpression\n\n\n  Look around! Countless insects are flying\n  And still follow honey trails as before,\n  But too many subtle signs are implying\n  \n    That the summer won’t be back anymore.\n  \n  Not by chance, on mornings of amber,\n  More translucent than the skin of the moon,\n  Gypsy moth, after hot-weather slumber,\n  \n    Flies to find a new wife very soon.\n  \n  At the market—hurly-burly, slashed prices.\n  Bergamot pears? We have them. So sweet!\n  And if you are a bird, a few slices\n  \n    Of potato beetle’s larvae you’ll eat.\n  \n  Childhood is sadness itself. There, in the wastes,\n  Grandkids search for grandpa’s tobacco,\n  Cabbage whites and field browns they chase\n  \n    And they sing an old dance tune from Cracow:\n  \n  When, alas, our grandma will die,\n  We will lay her to rest, dust to dust,\n  So she’ll turn into a white butterfly\n  \n    When a hundred or a thousand years pass.\n  \n  Nothing’s changed in the yard’s verdant thicket,\n  Only asters, not poppies, bloom now.\n  More haphazard are the chirps of the cricket.\n  \n    And the hammock? No one’s weighing it down.\n  \n  Shrubs and bushes give us an impression\n  That they flaunt the hue of their bugs,\n  While a cohort of young craftsmen in session\n  Red Cahors in the cooper’s yard chugs.\n\n\nNote II\n\nPreparation of Cartridges\n\n\n  1\n  I strolled the other day\n  In the forest of pine.\n  The sand of its trails,\n  Its needle and its leaf,\n  Including arrowleaf—\n  Everything was dry.\n  And I was mad that I\n  Was foolish to put on\n  These wetwalkers of mine\n  \n    And don a slicker too.\n  \n  So now, more mindful, I,\n  Getting ready to go,\n  Retired both the waders and the raincoat.\n  Then sunshine rain caught me on my way—\n  I ran and tried to hide;\n  \n    When I came home, I shook all over.\n  \n  My lonesome babe kept scolding: Serves you right,\n  I warned you—legs are throbbing—but you\n  Preferred to listen to the wagging dog’s tail—\n  You banned the coat, discarded the gummies.\n  \n    Oh, daydreamer, she went on, oh, hothead.\n  \n  2\n  You have a magic box!\n  In it you keep all things\n  Needed for hunting with a rifle.\n  So with no further words\n  Open it; from inside\n  Take out some carton tubes,\n  And also a few caps\n  Invented by the late Monsieur Gévelot.\n  And in these carton tubes\n  Thrust these Gévelot caps\n  And sprinkle powder there.\n  \n    Go, fellow!\n  \n  Using a thick sack cut into small lots,\n  Or worn felt boots, or flannel pajamas,\n  Insert a plug; follow with some shot;\n  \n    And then another plug securely jam in.\n  \n  Sir French is sitting headless on a chair.\n  My dear field marshal, it seems you’re not well.\n  The gentleman became slightly wrinkled.\n  Who dared to do this? Maybe Jomini\n  \n    Swung his sharp saber from beyond La Manche?\n  \n  Sir French is sitting stately on the chair,\n  The sizes of the shot are six and five,\n  But since the barrel is caliber twenty,\n  \n    The shells’ caliber is also twenty-two.\n  \n  My powder’s smoky like grandpa’s tobacco,\n  And flashes of old age astonished my forehead,\n  The clock tick-tocks, imagining one thing,\n  \n    Imagining the other, imagining something.\n  \n  My lonesome babe’s asleep, chock-full of kissel.\n  \n    Well, may she dream of my love for her.\n  \n  And I—of hunting.\n\n\nNote III\n\nThe Time Between\n\n\n  The time between wolf and hound\n  Is good for a chat soul to soul.\n  Though the lunch isn’t lavish at all,\n  You’ll be able to talk round and round\n  \n    With both, the wolf and the hound.\n  \n  It’s good that near the pond,\n  Sitting on a branch of oak tree,\n  The Hoopoe pipes with great glee\n  And repeats on and on:\n  \n    How good I feel by the pond.\n  \n  A handcar mournfully brays\n  From the versta thirty-and-four.\n  The vistas can’t be bare any more.\n  The store is closed for a day.\n  \n    Boredom. The handcar still brays.\n  \n  A jug dripped a drop on the plate,\n  The cricket knows its place well.\n  But really, can anyone tell\n  Whether it’s early or late?\n  \n    It dripped again on the plate.\n  \n  You’ll be able to talk round and round,\n  Of course, if the topic is right.\n  If it’s not, have a good night:\n  Evening drags, as if spellbound,\n  After the wolf and the hound.\n\n\nNote IV\n\nThe Grinder\n\n(A Conversation with a Critic)\n\n\n  Don’t sleep on the ground—you’ll get weary,\n  You’ll be barely moving at all!\n  Scat, my carper, stop nagging, you’re dreary!\n  I am dreaming that a valiant flag-bearer\n  Gave me weapons that used to be fairer,\n  \n    And they need to be sharpened—they’re dull.\n  \n  Do I love such weather, so pleasing,\n  When the clouds are suddenly gone,\n  And the masses can notice much easier\n  The appearance, let’s not say: of a cuckoo,\n  But correctly, let’s say: of the Hoopoe\n  \n    Who is cranking his grinding flint stone?\n  \n  You bet. But what, one may ponder,\n  The sound of the Hoopoe’s loud grind\n  Resembles at this moment of wonder?\n  It sounds like someone is crunching\n  The old chicken bone you were munching,\n  \n    But then left it, unfinished, behind.\n  \n  Enlightenment’s reins briefly dropping,\n  In a turban and caftan, hakeem,\n  The folk akyn, all in motion,\n  Across a steep gully is hopping,\n  Comparing, full of emotions,\n  \n    The grinding to the sound of a stream.\n  \n  What a dank, clammy autumn! It’s taxing.\n  But the Hoopoe is bothered not\n  By the fact he doesn’t have access\n  To dull scythes, or sickles, or axes,\n  But because nobody asks him:\n  \n    Please, put on my scarf and my coat.\n  \n  At the moment, the grinder figure,\n  A dullard, a dolt, round the bend,\n  Upset that he’s not a gravedigger,\n  A builder, a tinker, a baker,\n  A light carrier or a toy maker,\n  \n    Sings something about motherland.\n  \n  That’s life: By the invalids’ home,\n  Which, in winter, has a rink at its gate,\n  The Hoopoe approaches the lame,\n  Or rather, one-legged gnome,\n  Blind and mute, hunchbacked, and tame,\n  \n    And keeps honing his lone figure skate.\n  \n  Just look—and pass by, heed this lesson:\n  Someone’s grief is not a true grief.\n  Even more, ’cause no one can lessen\n  Pains of those whom fate so distresses\n  That the scorching sun can’t impress them,\n  \n    Hence, no deluge can bring them relief.\n  \n  Darkness falls. Irked by fate’s treason,\n  Like a hungry Gorgon would do,\n  The leaf fall’s whispering season\n  Stalks the verb-herd servile and sleazy,\n  But—sees no rhyme and no reason,\n  And the actual herd—is gone too.\n\n\nNote V\n\nOctober\n\n\n  Is it really October? Such a balmy air\n  That if not for the rustling of leaf fall,\n  One could simply forget about everything\n  And for hours stare into farnowheres.\n  \n    And smell sagebrush.\n  \n  But one has to live, to act, to go on,\n  Worry about the presence of kindling,\n  One has to sew new squirrel slip-ons,\n  \n    Stockpile mushrooms and go hunting.\n  \n  \n    Inasmuch as winter is certain.\n  \n  Carelessly showing the white of face,\n  Here I am; I’d like to listen to the Hoopoe.\n  Go on, rattle, cuckoo, my dear hooting whoop,\n  \n    Tiny toy, trifle, trinket, true treasure.\n  \n  Who knows where and for what reason\n  Someone with a drum roams the copses;\n  Spindlewort, fusoria, fusanum,\n  Scarletberry, snakeberry, solanum.\n  With a glow of roll-ups,\n  Fragments of vulgar phrases,\n  A part of speech known by the name of cough,\n  And with the moaning of rowlocks\n  Resembling the mallard’s call,\n  Approaches a gaggle of ragged freeshooters.\n  It’s beginning.\n\n\nNote VI\n\nPas d’Espaigne\n\n(Recollection of the City)\n\n\n  Mozart’s music was merrily sounding\n  One day in the old city park,\n  A lady was blissfully longing,\n  But for whom, she was still in the dark.\n  Among the musicians, excited,\n  A visiting cornet spun around,\n  And for tête-à-tête he invited\n  The lady to a quaint restaurant.\n  Pas d’Espaigne is a wonderful dance,\n  Because it’s so easy to learn:\n  Two steps back, then two to advance,\n  Turn around, and repeat all again.\n  In the evening, when all dancers vanished,\n  He became her friend and her crush.\n  He appeared to her to be Spanish,\n  And, all of a sudden, she blushed.\n  Next day, at the quay, she was musing:\n  Should she ask for a farewell encore?\n  In the old city park Mozart’s music\n  From that morning sounded no more.\n\n\nNote VII\n\nPostal Chores in the Month of November\n\n\n  The leaves and the birds—they all went flying.\n  The first—off trees, the other—southbound.\n  Soon, on warm mittens we’ll be relying\n  \n    So our hands can be safe and sound.\n  \n  Yet ere the frosts and blizzards commence,\n  To orphan winter prelude in light gray,\n  Nigh is the time of Saint Vitus’s dance,\n  \n    Devoted brother of the bag and jail.\n  \n  In this connection, letters—piles of them,\n  And telegrams—ready for this day,\n  Have to be sent. Just two words: I am.\n  \n    To all addresses. And without delay.\n  \n  Have to be sent, while telegraph wires\n  Can still be seen and we’re still not late.\n  I am—before people light their fires,\n  \n    Before the cities finally lock their gates.\n  \n  Have to be sent. Where’s the ink for my stilo?\n  Perhaps the twilight sucked it up dry?\n  I am! And to the Chinese, to Manila:\n  \n    Bin ich?—asking for their advice—Am I?\n  \n  Have to be sent, with a short note—urgent,\n  By a swift gryphon or by the pale mare,\n  Or, using the term of the postal agent,\n  \n    Pounded like cutlets, leaving none to spare.\n  \n  That’s what I chose and, whacked by asthma,\n  Went to the cellar, for a swig down there.\n  And when I crawled out, pleasantly plastered,\n  A vespertilio flashed in the air.\n\n\nNote VIII\n\nInsomnia\n\n\n  There’s no sleep in either eye\n  (The chemist’s right, alas—years fly),\n  But who would need it anyway,\n  With a velveteen ribbon around its crown,\n  And with a bit of a tilt?\n  \n    At the first sight—just a sieve.\n  \n  I see it all as if it were now:\n  Darkness entered my pines,\n  Caressed this and that,\n  And then, out of the blue\n  A hat with a tilt floated up;\n  \n    Such a dashing chapeau.\n  \n  Thin fog stole out from the stream,\n  A racer slithered into the sward to sleep.\n  An oriole kept sewing evening into night.\n  I figured: That’s who needed a sieve!\n  Only, I thought, why with a tilt?\n  \n    And a crane stood in the reeds.\n  \n  I wiped my monocle and put it on—\n  My goodness, it’s only a canotier . . .\n  The mallards burst out from the sedge—frrr!\n  Thinking about it, just how many years\n  Flowed ever since into the sieve with a tilt?\n  Alas, the chemist is quite right, oh my.\n\n\nNote IX\n\nAs If One Salted . . .\n\n\n  Some mornings, when your boredom rages,\n  It seems you’re waiting for some tip.\n  Either you skim through Pushkin’s pages\n  \n    Or Pushchin’s volume dully flip.\n  \n  The hunt no longer seems arresting.\n  Your whipper-in does not take down\n  The horn and harness idly resting.\n  \n    And hunting grounds in sadness drown.\n  \n  And you’re so glum, as one may gather,\n  That faithful ale can’t make life right.\n  Should you clean your chibouk or rather\n  \n    Challenge your neighbor to a fight?\n  \n  Or your old robe that’s tight and scratches\n  Should you demand to cut today,\n  So for the new one you’ll have patches?\n  \n    Or should you simply run away?\n  \n  Instead, to calm depression’s fervor,\n  You take a stroll pour l’appetite.\n  And later, with your household servants\n  \n    You play cerceau just à petit.\n  \n  Or risking a snob’s reputation,\n  You proudly board your charabanc\n  With English Club’s bright decorations,\n  \n    And ride stiff like a wooden chunk.\n  \n  It’s fall, may readers be reminded,\n  Therefore, the last leaf will alight,\n  When your gaze, truly absentminded,\n  \n    Will bless it on its final flight.\n  \n  Dusk, like a wolf from forest’s stubble,\n  Yawns, when the lights go on, at last.\n  But you forget about your troubles\n  \n    And urge the coachman, shouting: Fast!\n  \n  Because white flies begin to flutter\n  High in the air, for all to see.\n  You rush home, open window shutters:\n  \n    Oh, nanny, look—what can it be?\n  \n  As if one salted over yonder\n  Bathhouses, barns, and every hut . . .\n  Ah, snow has fallen! What a wonder!\n  And winter started just like that.\n\n",

  content: "It was Pyotr, one smart aleck from Sloboda, who took \nsomethin to town—either to sell or to buy; it’s impossible to make out from such a distance: I went far away \nlookin for seasonal work and my storm lamp doesn’t purrcolate much in the alien darkness, while my years ain’t a match \nfor bird’s sight. Pyotr is quite fine, but Pavel, his nephew, is \nworried, he’s sendin him a triangular letter. Their furry-legged \npostal cooer arrives at the lodge, sees how Pyotr with the other \nhuntin gards mercilessly abuses the wine, tosses them knucklebones, starts makin noise with songs. The cooer pecks Pyotr \non his temple and keeps sayin: You, Pyotr, drink your fill, but \nunderstand the drill. Pyotr takes the letter, opens it, and somethin is written there. My dear uncle Pete—that’s what is written there—I am no longer hopin you’ll bring back any yeast, \nbut I keep hopin that durin your mercantile absence from our \nplaces you did not live like a heartless windbag, but that you \nboldly dreamed about the alphabet. In tears, Pyotr begs his \ncomrades in the crashbaret: Help me with advice ’cuz I’m dyin \nhere. Pavel sent me to Gorodnishche; who knows whether to \nsell or to buy, I just know he’s mad I’m slower than molasses in \nJanuary, and right now I’ve got neither the merchandise nor \nthe money, and even less the yeast vital to him. He’s naggin me \nfrom the other shore: Do whatever you want, he says, but abstain from an empty-handed return. Well, perhaps it will be \npossible to reciprocally extract the hooch-brewin yeast from \nsomeone, but where can one get the letter zhe; it has stumped \nus, enlighteners. With the letter ge, shares Pyotr, we came up \nwithout a problem; it resembles the gallows, it does, ’cuz on \nthe gallows you can pronounce only that letter: ge, ge, and ge. \nThe letter de is like a dacha, be almost like ve, and ve almost like \nbe, but zhe—that one’s mysterious. At that moment, worn out \nby everyday hardships and by lashin incessant downpours, I \nalso report to the crashbaret in person—a prophet who stole \nfrom Christians two hours of light in the month of July—I \ndrop in to celebrate the conclusion of my unsuccessful to the \nhilt and to the core business. I met a certain blind man in an \nunsightly place, and he volunteered to accompany me to the \nwater for repose. And I trudged after him, trustin him in everythin, but the darkness engulfed us and for that reason he did \nnot notice a huntin pit and tumbled in. I also fell in, followin \nthe leader, ’cuz my belt was tied to his with a strong rope so we \nwouldn’t get separated. Halloo, we did not get separated, we \nmoaned with banged heads and with dislocations, halloo, we \ndid not get separated, we kept jokin, continuin our journey \nwith difficulty. But we were jokin untimely, comrades in misfortune. ’Cuz, when it turned light, I discovered that my grindin stand suffered durin the fall more than we did. The main \nwheel had cracked in many places and in that region it was \nimpossible to find a competent wheel fixer or a cooper to \nundertake the real repair. Therefore, havin suffered enough \nfrom sharpenin on the damaged construction, exosted, I was returnin to the winter quarters ahead of schedule. I was ploddin \nwith empty pockets and nothin clinked in them. And as long as \nI was ploddin, figurin out with what I was gonna pay in the \neatery, the main wheel was breakin more and more; it was the \nHay-rot season. Beside myself, I drop in and greet the tramps \npresent there. And meanwhile, the rim finally split in two and \nfell apart. I looked: The pieces were lyin at my feet. Cursin my \nunenviable lot, angry, I roughed up the apparatus to take out \nfrom circulation the crosspiece with the bushin, which, without the rim, looked strangely orphaned. I took it out, threw it \non the floor, and spat. And the crosspiece fell precisely between them, between them two rim fragments, while they \nwere lyin sorta resemblin two thin crescents, with backs to \neach other and with faces—here and there: one young, the \nother Krylobyl, on the wane. And then Krylobyl, the wise warden, about whom songs were already made in those days, when \nwe, dear Pozhilykh of mine, weren’t even close to bein present, \nhe, who was registered here from the very beginnin of beginnins, always wore garments lined with fish fur, and brewed \nhooch and rotgut from times immemorial, he squinted, moonfaced, and turned to Pyotr. ’Nuf grievin about your grief, \nLukich: Ain’t the thing thrown on the floor by one beggar a \ntreasure for another one? Look more carefully: Ain’t the thing \nyou’re searchin for lyin in the dust of this sickler, thrown there \nneglectfully by Ilya? Pyotr reproaches the warden, puttin him \nto shame: You like to play games with my weak mind, what the \nhell for do I and Pavel need the worthless wheel of the grindin \nmechanism, and it is still unknown whether the owner will let \nus take it, perhaps he himself needs it? Krylobyl teaches the \none bein taught in the crashbaret on the hill: I don’t wanna \nteach you to pick up someone’s things; you yourself know how \nto do it; I am teachin you somethin else. You are speakin in \nriddles, Pyotr said to Krylobyl, you’re teachin in riddles, to \nKrylobyl said Pyotr, oh, in riddles. And they had a drink. And \nthe others, with the exception of this here correspondent of \nYourses, also had a swig, while the latter just licked his lips. \nWell, said Krylobyl, sniffin his sleeve as a chaser, what kind of \nsound can be heard at the Wolf River, when one of our grinders \nstarts workin on his grindin stand, ain’t it zhe-zhe-zhe? Exactly. \nThat’s why I am askin, Krylobyl continued talkin to Pyotr: The \nwheel from the grindin stand, which is lyin in the dust of this \nsickler turned upside down, ain’t it sorta-kinda the sought letter? The public looked and gasped—ha, the spittin image. Verily, verily you’re teachin, Pavel and I will have a zhe, Pyotr rejoiced, only it’s a pity that money, he rejoiced, I don’t have, \notherwise I would treat you accordin to your needs. Don’t rack \nyour brains too much, Krylobyl calms him down, don’t despair, go and borrow from someone. But from whom can I borrow, despairs Pyotr, if here everybody gets hold of money by \nborrowin. And did you try to ask Manul, Manul beckoned to \nhim. And this Manul, permit me to recommend, up to a certain \ntime did not use money, even though he enjoyed himself, ’cuz \nhe was treated for free, on the house, splittin for this purpose a \ncertain madam with a not so bad fysik, who was a server here, \nin the establishment, and indulged the warden in everythin \nfrom A to Z, and for that reason he was able to put away his \npension for rainy days. And when they came, when Manul’s \nparamour, light bay from head to toe, sailed away on the inspector’s cutter and left for her abandonee a written note, \n“Don’t look for me, please,” then Manul set out to have a talk \nwith the inspector in the Other Places, and came back only \nthree years ago. Nothin happened to him—he started enjoyin \nhimself again, but now at real cost and, like all of us, makin purchases with what we call cash, which, however, so far he has, \nwhile in our anaconda purses there is a fundamental confusion. Pyotr sits down next to Manul the warden and looks at \nhim from the bottom of his heart. After a while, the latter asks \nPyotr: Why are you starin at me, haven’t you ever seen me before, and don’t you have nothin else to stare at? Exetera. Well, \nyou see, I wanna try, Pyotr apologizes, to borrow some means \nfrom you. So go ahead, try, Manul instructs, otherwise what’s \nthe use starin in vain? Hearin this, Pyotr replies to Manul with \nsimplicity: Warden-warden, be my friend, lend me some. I can \nnever be your friend, pal; after all, I am a warden and you’re just \nan upstreamer, but money, don’t be cross, I will give you—I’m \nnot a cheapskate. And gives him big money. The public lived it \nup well on Manul’s savins, Sidor Fomich, and they also nodded \nto me to join them. ’Cuz, after all, whose wheel cracked, if one \nthinks about it? Ain’t no misfortune without good fortune, and \nso Dzynzyrela suddenly got lucky.\n\nAnd the river answers my request: I will give you a stone to \nput either under your head or on your neck—take it, be my \nguest, but in the latter case don’t blame me, you won’t eat them \nmussels to your health, alas, but they will eat you with pleasure. \nI respond: Hold on, I’ll postpone my despair for a while, \ngimme the mussels now at dusk. Take off your new fashionable \npantofle, she says, roll up your galife as high as it’ll possibly go, \nstep into me up to your knees, and wander slowly, pinchin the \nbottom with your foot; I guarantee you’ll discover what you \nneed in a jiffy. I follow the river’s advice and step into it, flowin, \nand eventually stuff my shoulder bag to the gills. I set up in \nsome hollow a bonfire—I keep fryin, boilin, bakin, and simultaneously dryin my unsofiscated rags, which, God be praised, \nI still own. They get bigger every passin year; I am witherin, \nwiltin, and at the same time I’m losin my mind. A certain lonesome babe—I repent, I repent, I attached myself to her without \nwakin up the sacred feelins, just to have a harbor, a warm bench, \nor a couch to throw my bones on, as in the workshop the drafts \nblow from all the cracks, the bed is dank, scares-nightmares \ncrawl out from all the corners—so this lonesome babe, washin \nmy substantial apparels, kept esplainin that my flesh is dryin \nout ’cuz I have no strength to forget Orina. You are stuck on \nher, said my friend, you are stuck, and as a result, my life’s bitter. \nAnd when you’re sleepin, sometimes you grab me, you shove \nyour puppy in all my places, but you call her—and I’m jealous. \nYou’re achin for the tart with your entire feeble, booze-infused \nguts and your brains half and half with your snot drip out from \nyou and spread on your work clothes, and the winds are dryin \nthem. That’s right, Sidor Fomich, You will touch when we personally meet, You will touch the fabric of my mantilla—see, \nlike a scab. I pity you, the woman grieved about me, nomadic is \nyour lot, you are a bunch of grass, dry and scattered; it would be \nbetter if He took you to Himself quickly, so you wouldn’t suffer \nno more hardships in this world, wouldn’t blabber nonsense, \nwouldn’t abuse them ironwares in vain, wouldn’t make sparks \nat night, wouldn’t hide them dawns from the useful citizens, \nwouldn’t long no more for the cheater. Otherwise, your bean \nwill finally dry up like the vobla and you will become completely stupid, like the dolt at the mill who has lost all his wits \nas if someone hit him with a heavy sack. That’s how she grieved, \nadjustin my old rags, and her jeremiad resounded far and wide. \nAnd I was thinkin to myself, sittin in the nappin shed: Abandon hopes for my quick departure, I will loom here-there a little more, I will be an eyesore for some folks a bit longer, I will \nbreathe down the neck of some folks, I will still lift my walleye \nunto the sky. Mumbo-jumbo, You will probably think, what kind \nof a shed are you talkin about? What can I say? A shed like any \nother, only for nappin. There are containers, all kinds of things, \nspices, food, and about half a dozen of mousetraps manufactured by the Sankt-Petersburg spring co-op. Hard to believe: Is \nit possible that the need for them clapsnaps reached even the \nmain capital? There are also brooms, and bathhouse twigs, a \nstockpile of candles, everythin’s in order, everythin’s shipshape. \nBut besides this you notice somethin particular: There is a mattress filled with all kinds of stuff. You break your back the entire day, circulate from house to house or from workshop to \nworkshop, drop in for an hour to the crashbaret, then you glide \nunder the wing of your fiendish witch, and she starts grumblin: \nGo split some logs, go chop the wood, otherwise, lazybones, in \ndue course you’ll fly out from these digs. So you’re forced to hop \nand gallop to the log pile, hit and split wood with the hatchet. \nAnd the only light in your window—spring, April, when you \ncan finally vanish into thin air—will shine beyond the Itil until the first mornin frosts. And for now, kiddo, there’s no place \nto go, and the blizzard, fella, wolfs you down. So I chopped, \nhacked—and from that moment until supper Ilya’s involved in \na smoke break in the shed and a nap on the cherished junk. \nGutenacht to me, but if the nap doesn’t happen? I toss and turn \nand, in order not to lie there uselessly, I patch them gaps in education. The books I own are few but wonderful, old. There’s \namong them one about a mouse. It’s not big, I agree, but, after \nall, the mistress ain’t large either. Once upon a time, it claims, \nthere lived an old man and an old woman. Fine, I agree. And \nthey had, supposedly, Fenist the bird. Again, I’m not arguin, it’s \na natural thing; the folk around here are quite poor, but despite \nthat, one or two speckled specimens occasionally settle down \nin the attics of some individual owners. But not long, as a rule, \nnot long, unfortunately, is the life of them little souls. Somewhere, most likely, it is long, but not here, Beyond the Wolf. For \nreference: I don’t know about you, instigators, but we, grinders \nand wardens, consider Beyond the Wolf those places that lie \nacross the Wolf River, regardless from which side you look. I’ll \nesplain on an example. The lonesome babe sends Ilya for some \nlate morels—she’s started cravin, You see, somethin salty. I had \nbegged the dinghy from the co-op and set off to the Mangy \nPines. And You remain in the city, even though, undoubtfully, \nI invited You, too: Keep me company, I said. But then, it’s \nnot clear if You have a basket. But even if You don’t—no problem, ask some folks to let You carry one for a while, You’re an \nexperienced impersonator, refusal would be surprisin. However, in order not to cast a shadow on the fence, so to speak, \nand complicate the enterprise, I—when You start askin— \nI will wait in a hidey-hole. I am worried that if they realize that \nYou’re sailin for mushrooms with me, then in Gorodnishche’s \neyes You’ll get, unexpectedly, smeared with dirt. I will wait, \nI will, I’ll pinch some sorrel on the pasture, I’ll pull out some \nwild horseradish for later. Don’t reproach me for curiosity, but \ndo You, on Your part, consume this lovely root? Don’t be shy, \njust lemme know. Your word is law. Before You had a chance \nto blink—I already pulled out enough for You, too. And somethin else: Rubber boots, have You managed to procure rubber \nboots for Yourself? I don’t have them, but don’t compare Yourself to me, I am not the best example, from Easter until the Intercession I strut around barefooted—I’m used to it, my sole \nis abrasive, eternal: My heel’s like sandpaper, but even it gets \npenetrated by mornin dews. However, I don’t complain, someone much more famous than we had suffered, recommendin \nwe do the same. In contrast, on the Intercession, when the \nfrosts harden all the mud—right away I put my valenok on and \nno fiend is a match for me. And when the waters freeze—go \nahead, tie a blade with a rope and vamoose. Therefore, anythin \nelse maybe, but a boot, figurelatively speakin, doesn’t pinch us. \nPerhaps You will prick up Your ears in my address: That there’s \nno boot in the grinder’s possession—there’s no special wonder \neither, but by whose generosity did he get hold of the valenok? \nI’ll make a confession: I snagged the footwear one day.\n\nCold, mold, hunger everywhere, ground drafts, typhus— \nwhatever you want—but with valenki there’s a defective. True, \nin the ward, let’s give it its due, there was a pair—but one for all, \nso the patients could take turns and manage their promenaids. \nUsually with a certain colleague we managed for two. Fortune \nsmiled on us, you may say; he’s missin this one and I the opposite, so we sniffed each other out like two mutts. Two boots of \nleather flock together; everybody around recognized us with \nrespect. To change the dressin, to get a supply of pills from a \nnurse, to deploy ourselves in the corner with the auntie from \nthe female ward—everywhere we scurry side by side. Where, \nas in the song, goes the right hoof, there the left claw follows; \nhowever, over there it resembles more the first, and over here it \ntakes more after the second. Irreplaceable for each other we \nwere also durin the abovementioned promenaids. ’Cuz, really, \nis it possible to manage a lot individually in the nippy outside—complete gloom. Some barely walkin almost-goner will \nstroll for five minutes, admire the orphan lindens, remember \nhis father’s orchard—and he’s had enough. He’ll track back, \nfrownin, take off the valenki and throw them away: Who’d like \nto slide them checkers with me, he asks, sorta makin a smile \nwith his mouth, while melancholy’s eatin him up. Look, be so \nkind, into my stern eyes, look, perhaps, for the last time—that’s \nhis philosophy. And my and my colleague’s is opposite. We divide this snow-dusted pair with our hands tremblin from joy, \neach of us puts on what’s his, and we’re hoppin into the open \nair. It is wonderful outside—our native land. Kinda mother, \nbut strikingly sly, deceitful. In the beginnin, overall, it appears \nto be—land like land, only poor, with nothin in it. But after \nyou’ve made yourself at home, looked more carefully—there’s \neverythin in it, except valenki. We hobble, resolutely, to pediatric haunts—come and see: here you’ve got a frozen hill, and a \nsnow fortress, like Pyotr Alexeich had in Botfortovo, and the \nhospital cats, fat, well-nourished on our hospital fare, with \ntheir cheeks, as the sayin goes, visible from the back. There is \nalso the hospital coal sled—we used it, too. After sleddin, gettin filthy, and fillin our boot tops with snow, we start a snowball \nfight with the recuperatin young’uns. They hurt, they laugh, \nand thru the pane their doctor shakes his fist in vain, when he \nsees it. At first the kids kept their distance from us, especially \nfrom me. And why not; even I, before becomin familiar with \nmyself, was afraid to stare in mirrors—such a mug is no joke, \nnot to mention that the leg of my pajamas flutters empty. But \ngradually the tykes became tame, even got attached to us, I’d \nsay. Sometimes, we only hear: Grampa Lyusha—that’s what \nthey called me—Grampa Lyusha, tell us a story, give us a piggyback ride, and don’t hide your stump, show us. That is, they \ndrove us bonkers. At the same time, to Alfeyev, Yakov Ilyich, \nthey stuck like leaves from bathhouse twigs. And he was a poet, \na versifier, he put together delightful couplets for them; You \nand I are nothin in comparison with him, my Sidor, Isidor. \nI would quote these compositions of his, but I’m afraid You \nwon’t approve; they are picturesque, that is, decent not for everybody. For instance, the poem about the homeless dog. \nOnce a bitch her cooter against the fence knocked, and now \nshe is achin—her cooter got blocked. And after that I am quite \nembarrassed, Fomich. Just imagine: But three friendly stud \ndogs helped her with the pain, they did what was needed—\nshe’s happy again. Just think! And other pieces similar to that. \nHow much fun our nippers had! Well, we did some work, had \nfun with the tots—and the night is fallin. It’s time for us, consequently, to get to the theater. In the thicket stood, secluded, \nunder the number one, a hunchbacked house. Not really a \nhouse but a former chapel with an amputated cross, and some \nwhitish plants, perhaps willows, were bendin over it, like anatomists. And a sign with old-fashioned letters announced: Anatomical Theater. A familiar orderly carried out his duties there. \nRight away we go to see him in the cellar: Are you keepin \nwatch? Come on, show us your artists. The orderly opens the \nvaults wide: Have a look, I don’t mind, so far I don’t charge for \nshows. He knew them by histories of their illnesses, with all the \ndetails, by heart—who took poison, who burned from cancer, \nwho got crushed, and who went simply out of stupidity. I remember, he had in storage for about two weeks a gal of non-advanced age. On the skinny side, redheaded, collarbones and \nankels, with curly hair everywhere. Her relatives could not be \nfound; it would be time to bury her—but there’s a problem, \nthere’s no one to do it. She was nice, very nice, and though \ndead, but not sad; she was smilin—as if it was not about her—\nand the decay did not touch her body at all, unlike it does to \nmany others. I dare to hope that the serafims were gardin her \nbetter. She passed away from hot shakes, she entrusted herself, \nunlucky, to some young guy, but was not able to forget him \nsoon enough—and goodbye. Orya, I am grief-stricken, Orya, \nis there anyone for whom you did not come true, couldn’t you \nhave sheltered Ilya at least? He, the beast, would have saved \nyou,  the  beauty,  from  all  adversities,  and  you’d  manage \ntogether somehow. ’Cuz what is unhappiness and what is happiness, if you think about it? Unhappiness is when there is no \nhappiness, and happiness, Orya, is when there’s no unhappiness. But ’nuf grievin. So, dear orderly, splash for us, please, \nsome governmental pure grain, give the invaliduals a small \nservin from the big health services. We are suppin and talkin. \nTo our hospitable host—a question: How can you stand it to \nwork in such a Tartar, ain’t it depressin, ain’t it disgustin? \nThere’s disrespect, sounds the answer; pathology is a cruel \nthing, the postmortem medics have no pity on our body, they \nkeep guttin, God forbid you croak, they won’t miss a spot. And \nthe young female student doctors do the same—such smarty-panties, they grab whatever they can. But move your own \nbrain, where could I hop off from the given position, where \nelse would I be able to decant free firewater for all of you lost \nsouls? And he himself in turn gets desperately concerned about \nus: What on earth made you the way you are, if it’s not a secret? \nI tell him—so and so, this and that way. And Alfeyev, Yakov \nIlyich—started spreadin war rumors. He reports that not too \nlong ago there began, supposedly, the most fiercest campaign, \nand he was shaved, as ill luck would have it, to fight on these \nfronts. To the positions, he recalls, a girl saw the soldier off. She \nsaw him off, but there’s shootin, there—the brave commander \norders: Forward march—he’s cussin—and if you don’t, I’ll \nshoot you. No way out—he had to march, and so, obviously, \nhis leg got torn away and thrown behind the fascines. He \nscreamed, he admits, like one bein slaughtered. A poet, a loquacious rhymester was Yakov Ilyich: Okeydokey, soldier’s \nwalkin, okeydokey, to the war. Or somethin more or less \ncivilian, related to transport: When my dear wife, he says, to \nthe conductor was promoted, with the controller an affair she \nplotted; I don’t know whether I should even care, but I already \ndon’t pay for my fare. Usually our conversations in the mortuary kept flowin like a stream, but even they flowed by and away, \nthey poured down like the sand in an hourglass. Everythin \npasses, but the worthy things first of all. Hello, discharge—you \ndescended, broke loose. Namely, one resplendent mornin, the \ngeneral hospital evacuator, doctor, visits the dinin hall. Even \nnot just a doctor but a hulk of a doc, a fatso. We are havin lunch: \ndinner, that is. It’s brought to our attention that tomorrow \nmornin Sidorov and Petrov with all their possessions are hobblin to disinfection, and afterward with affidavits of inability to \nwork are limpin without delay home. We’re in trouble, I and \nYakov. ’Cuz just for the sake of a good yarn I mentioned here \nSidorov and Petrov. Upon verification, it turned out that no \nPetrov and even less Sidorov were figures on this flayer’s removal list. Alfeyev and Your humble Ilya were figures there. \nMayday, Yakov Ilyich, I whispered, we’re bein condemned to \ndischarge. And he is requestin an additional servin. And our \nchef-cook, she asks angrily: What, didn’t you stuff yourself \nenough? Alfeyev answers meekly: When I was a nut case, a \nmedic woman advised me: When some unpleasant thing happens, munch as much as you can of somethin—and everythin \nwill vanish in a trice. What kind of unpleasant thing, the fat \ncook curses the poet, you are stretchin me over the rack. Well, \nsuch, Alfeyev replies calmly, such, that the chicken we had for \nthe second course turned out to be old, and it all got stuck in \nmy  teeth.  I  started  wondrin  again,  not  for  the  first  time. \nFrom where, reveal the secret hidin nothin, from what kind of \na highway such irrepressible enthusiasts had come about; after \nall, no such speckled bird has yet hatched from the world egg \nthat this health center is fated to chew. Our doctors of science \nused to fatten us up with porridge, and Alfeyev claims that it \ngot stuck. And not long, not long, I repeat, these small creatures live, since they should never peck on wasps. But even the \ncooer did not peck Petrukha on his temple as hard as they are \npeckin on wasps. And these are infected, sick, and it so happens that the feathered race goes through a plague. In my nappin book it’s written: The speckled one tasted the golden wasps \nand laid for the old folks an egg, not an ordinary one but \ngolden. It would seem nothin better could be even expected—\ntake it and fry. But not everythin turns to Allah’s glory beyond \nthe Itil. The old woman tried to break it, tried to break the \negg—but not quite. Her husband, a feeble seedpod, had no \nluck either. At that moment a relatively small gray mouse was \nrunnin by, attendin to her simple needs, and she saw the culinary difficulties. She gained speed, waved her tail, and brushed \nthe egg off on the floor. The egg fell and—bang—cracked. \nI realize, I realize, You are befuddled again: Why have you, disfigured Ilya, told me this mouth-to-mouth fable, what impelled-compelled you? I am also apologetic, if that’s the case, \nfor dumbfoundin You with my bewilderin story. But why, I’d \nlike to know, for what reason did they create the above parable \nat all, what is, I am askin, the point of this once-upon-a-time \ntale? That a mouse is stronger than a man? Doubtful, somethin \nlike that does not happen even Beyond the Wolf, and ain’t the \nfeeble old people livin right there? Or what? That, perhaps, all \nof us should protect mice, that they can be useful if one needs \nto break somethin in the household? About this we hold strictly \npersonal opinion. The same way as we exterminated from times \nimmemorial, we gard the tradition now. Are they frog princesses? Do they promise with a human voice a broken trough? \nPlease, don’t chastise me, Fomich, but I don’t understand suggestions of this kind. A completely different case is a cabbage, a \ngoat, and a wolf—that I understand, at least that is a riddle. But \nnot now—now the discharge is tormentin me. And the witchcook gives Yakov Ilyich a second helpin. We each chow down a \nhalf and start thinkin. Outside, a sheer blizzard twists the tangled hair of the bushes in the front yard and we, urchins, find \nourselves short of valenki. In addition to the situcraption here, \nwe don’t hold in our hands any profession whatsoever. Where \nshould we, figurelatively speakin, go to learn? You’ll get out, get \ndischarged—and the snowstorm will sweep you up like a street \nsweeper with his filthy sweepin broom. Friggin-frigged-frig, we \nstarted thinkin. And Yakov declares: Whatever it takes, but our \nbeloved valenki we should remove from the ward, we got attached to them—even more so ’cuz they have galoshes. What \ndo you mean?—I asked. I mean a side-warmer far away, when a \nGypsy slyboots takes his sheepskin to the consignment store, \nwhen there’s mud-slush—and we’re on skis. I’ve grasped my \ncomrade’s reasonin at once and propose before official discharge, without any reparations, to take to our heels. And documents? What do you need these documents for, you won’t get \nfull by eatin papers, especially if they’re fake. At least I have real \nones, he says, but not my own, at the front I served as another \nYakov, I blew away my exemption to him in backgammon. \nFor the sake of appearance, we’ve paged through the journal \nPig-Breedin and Youth and we’re sorta gettin ready for a stroll. \nThe floor attendant squinted his eyes and understood: You’re \nsplittin? So we’re kissin the communal valenki goodbye? Fine, \ntake them, we’ll still keep shirts on our backs, with one pair \nwe won’t get nowhere all the same. We bowed low, took our \nleave, and descended to the pit: Hey, orderly, orderly, give us \nsome chlamyses, after all, how are we gonna reach our destination only in pajamas? And Ivan shakes out from his depot heap \nupon heap of garments: Dig in. How many kindhearted souls \nare scattered around our damp cellars! May you prosper, Uncle \nVanechka, our male nurse, we are deeply in debt to your generosity. He esplained: Relatives bring new toilettes for the artists, \nand out of fear quite often don’t ask for the worn ones. I selected then for myself a blue admiral’s gala galife, I selected \nthen a clerk’s top hat with a tilt and a brick-colored Jewish lapserdak of cheviot wool. I believe I made a right choice; all three \nfabrics are durable, up until now they are my only outfit. \nWhat  Alfeyev  chose—I  don’t  recall  right  now,  and  abhor \nmakin things up. Perhaps he took the fashionable striped pants \nof antique moiré and a plaid jacket of thick zhorzhet. We got \ndressed, we got robed—So long, benefactor—and we bolted \nin a duet away from all these bandages, findin out beforehand \ninformation about the needed station: of the railroad, that is. \nHop, don’t stop, hop, don’t stop, granny sowed the peas for \ncrop; we gave it all we got, pullin our peaked caps down over \nour eyes like daredevils. But the storm’s turbulence, You understand, also gave it all it got, roughin us up.\n",

  content: "Это Петр, грамотей один слободской, повез что-то в город — \nпродавать, покупать ли, не разберешь на таком расстоянии: далеко \nотошел я на промысел, да и лампа моя штормовая не слишком фурычит в чужих потьмах, и лета мои не для птичьего зрения. Петру — что, он в полном порядке, а вот Павел, племяш его, озабочен, \nписьмо ему треугольное шлет. Прибывает турман их мохноногий \nна постоялый двор, видит — Петр с отдельными сторожами охотничьими винище употребляет немилосердно, в ко́зны режется, песни затеял шуметь. Турман Петра в темя клюет — приговаривает: ты, \nПетр, пить пей, да дело разумей. Петр письмо берет, распечатывает, \nа в нем написано что-то. Дядя Петь, там написано, дорогой, дрозжи \nя уже не надеюсь, что привезешь, но надеюсь пока что, что в торговом отрыве от наших мест ты не жил на продувное фуфу и про \nазбуку мечтал дерзновенно. Плачется слезно Петр в кубарэ товарищам: помогите советом, уж гибну я. Послан Павелом в Городнище \nне то покупать, не то продавать, знаю только — по смерть меня командировать выгодно и что нету сейчас ни товару, ни денег, а тем \nболее необходимых ему дрозжей. Теребит с того берега: мол, как \nхочешь, а от пустопорожнего возвращения воздержись. Ну, дрозжей \nбраговарных, возможно, у кого-нибудь и удастся заимообразно изъять, а вот жэ-букву где раздобыть, заколодило нам на ней, просветителям. Гэ-букву, Петр делится, выдумали без хлопот, она у нас наподобие виселицы, читай, потому что на виселице эту букву и выговоришь одну: гэ да гэ. Дэ — как дом, бэ — как вэ почти, вэ же почти \nкак бэ, а вот жэ — та загадочна. В эту пору, траченный бытовыми \nневзгодами и хлесткими обложными ливнями, в кубарэ задвигаюсь \nя, собственной своею персоной, пророк, два часа светлых спроворивший в июле месяце у христиан, — захожу, чтоб отпраздновать \nзавершение напрочь и вдрызг неудачного промысла моего. Встретился в слепой местности некоторый слепец, и он вызвался проводить на роздых к воде. И поплелся за ним, ему доверяя во всем, но \nтемнота нас объяла, и он не заметил поэтому ямы ловчей и ухнулся. \nСверзился вслед за вожатым и я, так как мой подпоясок связан был \nс подпояском его крепкой вервой, чтобы не растеряться нам. Вот \nи не растерялись, стенали с башками побитыми и с вывихами, вот \nи не растерялись, дурили мы, путь наш продолжая с трудом. Но не \nв добрый час веселились, товарищи по беде. Ведь когда развиднелось, тогда обнаруживаю, что завод мой точильный при падении \nпострадал пуще нас. Лопнуло генеральное колесо по всем линиям, \nи найти понимающего колесника или бондаря, чтоб дал настоящий \nремонт, в той округе не представлялось возможностью. Отчего, настрадавшись точить на ущербной конструкции, изнеможен, возвращался на зимние я фатеры до срока. Брел с пустыми карманами, \nи в них ничего не побрякивало. И пока я так брел, кумекая, чем намерен платить в ресторации, колесо это главное портилось все ужаснее; стоял сеногной. Вне себя захожу вовнутрь и приветствую присутствующих забулдыг. Обод мой при этом тогда окончательно репнулся и распался на обе части; я посмотрел: они лежали у ног моих. \nПроклиная незавидную свою участь, яростно я аппарат раскурочил, \nдабы вынуть из обращения крестовину со втулкой, которые смотрели без обода сиротливо чудно́. Вынул, бросил и плюнул. И легла крестовина в аккурат промеж них, двух обломков, а те лежали в подражание как бы тонким двум месяцам, один к другому спинами, а лицами — туда и сюда: один — молод, другой — Крылобыл, на ущербе. \nТогда Крылобыл, егерь мудрый, о ком уже куплеты слагали в те \nдни, когда нас, Пожилых Вы мой, и близко тут не присутствовало, \nон, который значился здесь с самого начала начал, носил всегда наряды на рыбьем меху и варивал спокону веков сиволдай и гнилье, \nон прищурился, месяцеликий, и обратился к Петру. Полно горе тебе горевать, Лукич: брошенное оземь нищим одним — не сокровище \nль для иного. Присмотрись повнимательней, разве не искомое тобою легло во прахе тошниловки сей, кинутое Илией в небрежении. \nПетр егеря упрекает, стыдя: игры ты над моим скудоумием изволишь играть, черта ли нам с Павелом в механизма точильного бросовом колесе, да и неизвестно еще, разрешит ли хозяин его забрать, \nможет, оно ему самому надобно. Крылобыл ученого учит в кубарэ \nна горе: я чужое имущество не хочу тебя учить подбирать, это ты \nсам умеешь, я тебя иному учу. Загадками ты говоришь, Петр Крылобылу сказал, загадками учишь, сказал Крылобылу Петр, ох загадками. Выпили они затем. И прочие, за исключением Вашенского \nкорреспондента, тоже приняли; последний же лишь облизнулся. \nВот, сказал Крылобыл, рукавом занюхивая, что это за звук раздается у нас над Волчьей, когда кто-либо из наших точильщиков заработает на точильном станке, не же-же-же ли? Ну. Оттого я и спрашиваю, продолжал Крылобыл Петру: колесо от станка точильного, \nлежащее во прахе тошниловки сей и вывернутое шиворот-наоборот, не есть ли вид буквы искомой. Публика посмотрела и ахнула — \nха, вылитое оно. Верно, верно ты учишь, будет нам с Павелом жэ, \nПетр радовался, жаль только денег у меня, радовался, нет, а не то \nвыставил бы я тебе по потребностям. А ты голову шибко себе не \nломай, Крылобыл успокаивает, не отчаивайся, взял да и подзанял \nу кого-нибудь. Да у кого же я подзайму, Петр отчаивается, если тут \nу нас все сами взаймы разживаются. А ты у Манула пробовал разве \nпросить, Манул его поманил. А Манул, разрешите рекомендовать, \nон до известного времени деньгами не пользовался, хотя и гулял, \nпотому что угощался задаром, на шермака, раскалывая на этот предмет одну ничего себе телесами мадам, которая здесь, в заведеньи, \nслужила и егерю потакала во всем от и до, почему пенсион его имел \nвозможность откладывать про черные дни. И когда они наступили, \nкогда отчалила сударка Манулова, вся соловая, на инспекторском \nкатерке и оставила своему брошенке писульку: прошу не искать; то \nМанул направляется потолковать с инспектором в Иные Места, \nи года лишь три как обратно. Ничего с ним не сделалось — опять \nзагулял, но теперь уж по-черному и, подобно всем нам, приобретая \nза те же самые тити-мити, которые, однако, у него покуда имеютсяесть, между тем как у нас в портмоне анакондовых капитальный \nконфуз. Петр подсаживается тогда к Манул-егерю и глядит на него \nиз самой души. Тот с течением времени спрашивает Петра: чего это \nты на меня загляделся, или не видал никогда до сих пор, и, что ли, \nглядеть тебе кроме некуда. И тому подобное. Да я, видишь, Петр \nоправдывается, средств хочу у тебя попробовать подзанять. Ну так \nи пробуй, Манул наставляет, а та́к чего зря глядеть-то. Петр Манулу на это выдает с прямотой: егерь-егерь, будь другом, займи мне \nв долг. Другом, приятель, тебе я побыть никак не могу, я ведь егерь, \nа ты — просто так верховет, но денег, не обижайся, дам — не выжига. \nИ дает ему денег больших. Широко разгулялась публика на Мануловы сбережения, Сидор Фомич, и мне тоже кивнули: подсаживайся. Потому что ведь чье колесо-то репнулось, если вдуматься. Нету \nхуда без нéхуда, вот и Дзынзырэла с удачей вдруг.\n\nИ река на запрос отвечает: камень я тебе хоть под голову, хоть на \nшею — бери, не жаль, но в последнем случае — не взыщи, ты ракушек уже не покушаешь на здоровье, увы, а они тебя — с удовольствием. Отзываюсь: повремени, я отчаиваться чуть-чуть погожу, мне \nракушек давай нынче в сумерки. Ты пантофель свой новомодный \nстяни, говорит, галифе засучи до предельной возможности и войди \nпо колено в меня и броди постепенно, пощупывая подошвой грунт; \nгарантирую, отыщешь необходимое живою рукой. Поступаю по совету реки и вступаю в нее, текучую, и набиваю в конечном итоге \nсуму переметную я внабой. Развожу в вертепе каком-нибудь костерок — жарю, парю, пеку, одновременно рубище сушу свое немудрящее, которым, слава Господу, владею еще. Великовато становится \nоно с году на год, сохну я, усыхаю в последние сроки да выживаю \nзаодно из ума. Мне бобылка одна — каюсь, каюсь, сошелся с нею, не \nпробуждая заветных чувств, лишь бы иметь пристанище, лавку теплую или топчан: кости бросить, в мастерской-то сквозит изо всех \nпазов, ложе волгло, мордасти из углов налезают — бобылка та, мои \nтуалеты великие перепарывая, объясняла, что плотью своею сохну, \nпоскольку Орину не в силах запамятовать. Вы присохли к ней, подруга сказала, присохли, мне горько выходит с того. И во сне иногда облапливаете, тычетесь кутенком во все у меня места, а зовете ее — \nя в ревности. Лярву вашу навидите всем пропитым нутром квелым, \nа мо́зги с сопельками пополам из вас вытекают и по робе стелются, \nи ветры их сушат. В самом деле, Сидор Фомич, Вы ощутите при \nличном свидании, ощутите мате́рью мантильи моей — ишь, короста. \nЖалко вас, женщина скорбела о мне, участь бродячья ваша, ком вы \nтравы, сухой и гонимый, уж побыстрей бы Он вас к себе прибрал, \nчтобы не мытарствовать вам далее по миру, чепухи не молоть, не \nтиранить же́лезы попусту, искры в ночах не сыпать, зорь бы не застить полезным гражданам, по изменнице бы уже не скучать. А то \nвывялит вам мякину вашу вконец, будто рыбе той воблой, и станете вовсе глупо́й, словно малый на мельничке, мешком стебанутый \nиз-за угла. Так скорбела, перепарывая шмотье, и далеко иеремиада \nее разносилась. Я же полагал про себя, находясь в катухе дремном: \nты надежды на скорый отход мой покинь, еще помаячу там-сям, еще \nпомозолю гляделки некоторым чуток, постою над душой у некоторых, послезит еще к небу бельмо мое. Туторки-матуторки, вы́, верно, помыслите, что это еще за катух там наметился. Что мне ответить? Катух как катух, только дремный. Есть сусеки в наличии, \nманатки разные, специи, снедь, мышеловок с полдюжины производства пружинной Санкт-Петербургской артели. Даже не верится: \nужель и до главной столицы нужда докатилась в капканчиках. Есть \nи метлы, и веники банные, запасец свечей — все порядком, все чинчинарем. Но, помимо того, подмечаешь особенность, есть матрац \nс начинкой из всячины. Наломаешься за день, накрутишься по дворам, по цехам ли, наведаешься на часок в кубарэ, сунешься после \nк злыдне под крылышко, а она — нащепите, ворчит, щепы, наколите \nдровец, а то ходом вы у меня, лежебок, с постоя вылетите. И приходится, скок-поскок у поленницы, тяп да ляп колуном. И единый \nсвет у тебя в окошке — весна, апрель, поминай тогда, бабка, как звали дедку, — зальется за Итиль до первых утренников. А пока что — \nкуда же ты, юноша, денешься, и вьюга тебя, залетку, поедом ест. \nНарубил, нащепил — и уж тут-то до самого ужина происходит \nу Илюши перекур с дремотой в катухе на заветной рухляди. Гутенахт мне, а если не дремлется? Извертишься весь и, чтоб зря не лежать, затыкаешь прорухи образования. Книгами обладаю не многими, но прелестными, давними. Есть меж ними одна и про мышь. \nНебольшая, не спорю, но ведь и барыня невелика. Жили-были, доказывает, старик со старухою. Ладно, уговорил. И была у них якобы птица Фенист. Тоже не спорю, свободная вещь, уж на что небогатый окрест народ, но и то у отдельных собственников нет-нет да \nпоселится на антресолях ряба-другая. Да недолог, как правило, недолог, к несчастью, малых сих век. Где-то, вероятно, и долог, да не \nу нас по Заволчью. Для справки: не знаю, как Вы, исследователи, — \nмы, точильщики и егеря, полагаем Заволчьем такие места, которые \nза Волчьей лежат, с которого бы берега ни соблюдать. Поясню на \nпримере. Снаряжает Илью бобылка по поздние какие-нибудь сморчки — на соленое ее, видите ли, потянуло. Выклянчил я у артели артельский челн и подался в Паршивый бор, Вы же в городе остаетесь, хоть я Вас, вне сомнения, и приглашал: мол, составьте компанию. \nВпрочем, неясно, лукошко имеете ли. Но если и нет — не проблема, \nпопро́сите у людей на понос, фигурант Вы солидный, отказ удивителен. Тень, однако, на прясла чтобы не наводить и предприятия не \nусложнять, я бы — когда просить станете — я в месте неявном бы \nпереждал. Я за то беспокоюсь, что если они осознают, что Вы со \nмной по грибы отплываете, то в глазах городнищенских как бы Вам \nне упасть паче чаяния в грязь лицом. Переждал, переждал бы, щавелю на выгоне пощипал, хрену дикого надергал бы про запас. Не \nкорите за любопытство, но Вы-то, простите за прямоту, корешок \nэтот кушаете? Не стесняйтесь, лишь дайте знать, Ваше слово — закон, Вы еще моргнуть не успели — а я уже и на Вашу долю надрал. \nИ другое: а сапоги, сапоги-то припасены у Вас? У меня-то вот нет, \nно на меня не равняйтесь, я — пример не из лучших, я от Пасхи до \nПокрова босиком щеголяю — обвык, подошву имею абразивную, \nвечную: бумага наждачная пята моя, но и то росы ранние пробирают ее. Однако не сетую, кое-кто познаменитее нас претерпел, рекомендуя и нам. Зато на Покров, когда грязи наши сплотит мороз, — \nсразу валенок я обул, и мне анчутка не брат. И как во́ды сковало — \nприкручивай вервием снегурок и шуруй. Так что что-что, а сапог \nнам, выражаясь окольно, не жмет. Тут Вы, может, насторожитесь \nв мой адрес: что сапога у точильщика нет — чуда особого тоже нет, \nно валенком с чьих щедрот он разжился? Приоткроюсь, подтибрил \nя некогда обувь.\n\nХолод, голод повсюду, поземка, тиф — все, что хочешь, а с валенками — дефектив. В отделении, правда, надо отдать ему должное, пара была — да одна на всех, чтобы попеременке в них пациенты могли променады соображать. Я обычно с коллегой одним соображал \nна двоих. Скажи, подфартило: у него этой нет, а у меня противоположной, и мы снюхались, как те бобики. Два сапога — пара, нас с почтением все узнавали вокруг. На перевязку, пилюлями ли у сестры \nотовариться, к тетке ли из дамского примениться в углу — всюду \nвместе шустрим. Куда, поется, правое копыто, туда и левая клешня, \nпричем там скорее на первое тянет, а тут на второе смахивает. Незаменимы один одному оказывались мы и в часы упомянутого променада. Действительно, много ли на дворе студеном индивидуально \nсообразишь — печалище. Иной доходяга ходячий побродит пяток \nминут, полюбуется на липы сиротские, вспомнит про отчий сад — \nи с него уж достаточно. Возвернется, насупленный, валенки снимет, \nшвырнет: кто со мной шашки двигать, опрашивает, делая как бы \nулыбку ртом, а тоскливость его донимает. Взгляни, будь добр, в глаза мои суровые, взгляни, быть может, в последний раз — такова его \nфилософия. У меня же с коллегой — обратная. Пару эту мы запорошенную руками, от радости торопливыми, разберем, напялим каждый его, и поскакали на воздух. Распрекрасно снаружи — родина. \nВроде — мать, но хитра поразительно, охмуряет. Поначалу все кажется — земля как земля, только бедная, нету в ней ничего. Но обживешься, присмотришься — все в ней есть, кроме валенок. Ковыляем решительно к педиатрическим кущам — пожалуйте: тут и горка вам ледяная, и крепость снежная, как в Ботфортове у Петра \nАлексеича, и коты больничные, жирные, откормленные на наших \nхарчах, щеки, что называется, со спины видать. Есть и санки угольные — тоже использовали. Накатаемся, исчумажемся, снегу за голенище себе наберем — поехали с пацанвой выздоравливающей в снежки. \nЕму и больно, и смешно, а врач грозит ему в окно, если видит. Дети \nнас сперва, особливо меня, сторонились. Еще бы нет, я и сам, покуда не примелькался себе, в зеркала опасался пялиться — шутка ль, \nрожа подобная, не говоря, что пижамина реет пуста. Постепенно, \nвпрочем, ручными ребята сделались, привязались к нам даже, я бы \nсказал. Только и слышишь, бывало: дед Люша — так звали они меня, — дед Люша, историю-то сочини, а на закорках-то провези, а культю-то свою не таи, показывай. То есть всю плешь проели. С тем же \nи к Алфееву они липли банными листиками, Якову Ильичу. Он же \nпоэт, стихотворец, стишата им составлял отменные, далеко до него \nнам с Вами, Сидор мой, Исидóр. Я бы сочинения эти его привел, но \nбоюсь — не похвалите, они с картинками, то есть приличные не для \nвсех. Например, поэма про пса бездомного. Стукнулась-де сучка \nдрючкой об забор, больно этой штучке, сделался запор. А далее мне \nдаже зазорно, Фомич. Представляете, подошли к собачке трое кобелей, сделали что надо — стало веселей. Ну Вы подумайте! И тому подобные номера. Вот уж радости спиногрызам-то нашим было. \nПозанимались, побалагурили с детворой — уже вечереет. Пора нам, \nследовательно, в театр. В зарослях особился, под номером раз, дом \nгорбатый. Дом — не дом, а часовня из бывших с ампутированным \nкрестом, и растенья белеющие, ивы что ли, склонились над ней, как \nанатомы. А табличка старинного начертания вам сообщала: анатомический театр. Там у нас санитар знакомый дежурства нес. Задвигаемся сразу к нему в подвал: сторожуешь? показывай давай артистов своих. Санитар погреба́ нараспах — смотри, не жаль, за показы \nпока не взимаю. По историям заболеваний он их всех как облупленных знал назубок — кто отравился, кто раком сгорел, кого придавило, кто просто по глупости. Лет несолидных деваха, я помню, \nхранилась недели две у него. Тощеватая, рыжая, ключицы да щиколки, а волос всюду кучерявый у ней. Родственников не могли для \nнее разыскать, хоронить бы пора — осечка, некому. Симпатичнаясимпатичная, и кончина ей — не кручина, усмехается — как ни при \nчем и не тронулась телом ничуть, не в пример многочисленным. \nСмею надеяться, что серафимы хранили ее сильней. От озноба горячего она отошла, доверилась неудачно парнишке какому-то, но \nпозабыть его вовремя не управилась — и прощай. Оря ты, Оря, печалюсь, кому же это ты не сбылась, приголубила бы лучше Илью, \nна худой конец, тот, страшила, тебя, красотулю, от всех бы напастей \nспас, вот бы ладили. Ведь что такое несчастье и что такое счастие, \nкогда задаться на миг? Несчастие — это если нет счастия, а счастие, \nОря, это если несчастия нет. Погоревали, и будет. Плесни теперь \nнам, голубчик дежурный, казенного чистяку, да перепадет индивидам малая толика от санитарии большой. Вечеряем, беседуем. Гостеприимцу — вопрос: как выдерживаешь в таком тартáре служить, \nведь не грустно, не гребостно ль? Грубость есть, раздается ответ, \nпатология — вещь жестокая, жалости к телу нашему не ведают посмертные лекаря, потрошат, не дай бог окочуриться — разделают \nпод орех. И меди́чки молоденькие туда же — уж наблатыкались, \nцапáют за что ни попадя. Но вы сами извилиной пошевелите, куда \nя с данной вакансии соскочу, где еще дармового горючего вам всем, \nнеприкаянным, нацежу. В свою очередь, огорчается напропалую за \nнас — а как это вас угораздило, ежели не секрет. Я ему — так и так \nи таким путем. А Алфеев, Яков Ильич, — в военные слухи ударился. \nДокладывает, что затеялась якобы кампания сильнеющая не слишком давно, и забрили его, как назло, на эти фронты воевать. На позиции, вспоминает, девушка провожала бойца. Проводила, а там постреливают, там — командир бравый, шагом марш, разоряется, не \nто — пристрелю. Ничего не попишешь — пришлось шагать, ну и оторвало, конечно, и выбросило к лешему за фашины. Орал, признается, А\nкак резаный. Поэт, былинник был речистый Яков Ильич, аты-баты, \nдокладывал, шли солдаты, аты-баты, рапортовал, на войну. Или более-менее гражданское, транспортное. Моя жена, говорит, в кондукторы пошла и с ревизором в тонкости вошла; что предпринять — \nпока не понимаю, но за проезд уж не плачу в трамвае. Ручьями \nструились в трупарне беседы обычно у нас, но протекли и они, просы́пались, будто песочек в часах. Все минуется, но достойное — \nв первую голову. Здравствуй, выписка, — ты грянула, разразилась. \nТак, в одно распрекрасное посещает столовку общебольничный эвакуатор, врач. Даже не столько врач, сколько врачина целый, амбал. \nМы обедаем: ужинаем. Доводится до нашего сведения, что Сидоров \nи Петров завтра утром со всеми пожитками кандыбают на дезинфекцию, а затем с белютня́ми нетрудовитости хромают неукоснительно \nпо домам. Дело швах наше с Яковом. Ибо это лишь краснобайства \nради я здесь указываю — Сидоров да Петров. На поверку же оборачивается, что никакой не Петров и еще меньше Сидоров в списке \nна удаление у живодера этого фигýровали. Там фигуровали Алфеев \nи Ваш покорный Илья. Полундра, Яков Ильич, я шептал, обрекаемся выписке. А он просит добавочной порции. Шеф же повар со злобой: чего, не налопался? Алфеев смиренно: когда психическим состоял, мне фельдшер советовала: чуть неприятность какая, прими \nв себя побольше чего-нибудь — и все как рукой. Какая такая неприятность, повар толстая поэта бранит, жилы ты из меня тянешь. А такая, Алфеев без трепета возражал, а такая, что кура, которая на второе была, старая оказалась, вся в зубах она у меня завязла. Диву \nя дался в который раз. Откуда, откройте секрет, не тая, с какого \nтакого шоссе энтузиасты у нас настолько неугомонные есть-пошли, \nведь не вылупилась еще та ряба из земного яйца, которую той лечебнице жевать суждено. Нас чумизой откармливали доктора наук, \nа Алфей утверждает — завязло-де. А недолго, недолго, я повторяю, \nптахи малые эти живут, потому что осу им ни в коем случае не стоит клевать. Но турман Петруху в темя так не клевал, как они осу. \nА та — заразная, болезненная, и случается у пернатых мор. В книге \nдремной моей начертано: отведала ряба золотушных ос и снесла пожилым не простое, а золотое. Казалось бы, лучшего и желать невозможно — бери и жарь. Но все не слава аллаху за Итилем. Била-била \nстаруха яйцо — не очень-то. Не преуспел и мужик ее, дряхлый стручок. Той порою бежала мимо по своим нехитрым надобностям относительно небольшая серая мышь, и она видит стряпчие трудности. \nРазбежалась, махнула хвостом и смахнула яичко на пол. То упало \nи — бац — и кокнулось. Я смекаю, смекаю, опять в недоумении Вы: \nдля чего ты мне, потерпевший Илья, байку эту из уст в уста передал, что тебя побудило-понудило? Извинительно и мне, если так, недоумением Вас своим огорошить. А к чему, желал бы я знать, для чего \nони притчу вышеизложенную составили-то вообще, в чем, я спрашиваю, бывальщины соль? В том, что мышь человека сильней? Ой \nли, подобного даже в Заволчье нет, а уж не там ли немощные старики живут-зажились. Или что? Что мышей, может быть, нам всем \nследует охранять, что они пригодятся разбить по хозяйству чего-нибудь? Об этом придерживаемся мнения сугубо собственного. Как \nизводили искони — так традицию и блюдем. Разве царевны-лягушки они? Корыто, что ли, разбитое голосом человечьим сулят? Не \nвелите казнить, Фомич, но не понимаю я намеков подобных. То ли \nдело — капуста, коза да волк, вот это, я понимаю, загадочка. Но не \nтеперь — ныне выписка мучает. И выдает злообразная повар добавки Якову Ильичу. Мы кушаем пополам и задумались. На дворе вьюга чистая, колтуны палисаднику вертит, а у ребяток с валенками \nпросак. В довершение всей ситуёвины и специальности не держим \nкакой бы то ни было мы в руках. Куда, фигурально соображая, на \nучебы податься? Выйдешь, выпишешься — изметелит тебя метелица, \nсловно метельщик поганой метлой. Ё-кэ-лэ-мэ-нэ, мы задумались. \nИ Яков промолвил: любыми путями валенки нами любимые должны мы из отделенья убрать, прилепились мы к ним — тем более что \nс калошами. Что ты имеешь в виду? — я спросил. Я бокогрей имею \nвдали, когда цыган-хитрованец цыгейку в комиссионку понес, когда грязь-слякоть, а мы — на лыжах. С полуслова я понял товарища \nи предлагаю до выписки, без всяческих контрибуций ноги отсюда \nумыть. А доку́менты? Чего тебе в тех документах, бумажками сыт \nне будешь, в частности если липовые. У меня хоть и настоящие, \n говорит, но не мои, за другого я Якова на позициях был, бро́ню ему \nсвою в триктрак профершпилил. Полистали для виду журнал Свиноводство и Мóлодежь и намыливаемся как бы гулять. Коридорный \nприщурился и додул: отваливаете? плакали, стало быть, валенки \nкоммунальные? ладно, берите, страшнее не обедняем, с единой парой кашу тут все одно не сварить. Мы откланялись и — в партер: \nсанитар-санитар, дай нам хламиды какие-нибудь, не в пижамах же \nдо мест назначения добираться. И вытряхивает Иван из каптерки \nодежд — ворох ворохом: налетай. Сколько ж душ добродушных по \nподвалам у нас сыроватым рассеяно! Благодарствуй, медбрат дядя \nВанечка, тароватости твоей мы племяннички. Объяснял: поновей \nтуалеты приносят артистам родичи, а обноски с испугу нередко не \nтребуют. Выбрал я тогда себе галифе адмиральское голубое, парадное, выбрал в тот раз чиновничий шапокляк набекрень и кирпичной расцветки жидовский шевиотовый лапсердак-с. Полагаю, не промахнулся, материи все три ноские, посейчас единственный мой обмундёр представляют собой. Что Алфееву показалось — не вспомню \nтеперь, а душой кривить презираю. Уж не моднеющие ли в полоску \nбрюки он взял, муар-антик, не клетчатый ли куртец, драп-жоржет. \nОбрядились, одернулись — бывай, щедрявый, и попилили дуэтом \nподальше от этих бинтов, наведя заведомо справки о нужной станции — даешь вокзал. Прыг-скок, прыг-скок, баба сеяла горох, мы \nдавали, картузы нахлобучивая по-залихватскому. Но и кутерьма \nбуревая давала нам, понимаете ли, прикурить.\n",

  content: "Yakov Ilyich Palamakhterov (by the way, here is his \nSelf-Portrait in Uniform; and yet, does it make sense \nto duplicate such impressive canvases without having any perceptible talent for this and understanding beforehand that the visitor will only briefly look at the copy as at the \nmost boring detail here; therefore, a little later, getting more \nand more lost and confusing reality with fantasy, he may declare once and for all: Yes, everything was exactly like that; \nand, evaluating it from the side or in a mirror, he may remain \ncompletely satisfied with his, no, not his, wait a moment, the \nhero’s, of course, the hero’s actions and features; to duplicate \nself-portraits in uniforms—I beg your pardon!) and so, Yakov \nIlyich Palamakhterov tried not to attract attention. In vain. It \nwould be difficult to imagine a man who, thanks to his lack of \ntalent for mimicry, would less resemble the Brazilian hunting \nspider or humpbacked Patagonian crickets—cf. Carus Sterne, \nEvolution of the World, Werden und Vergehen, translated from \nthe German, vol. 3, World Association Publishers, Moscow, 22 \nBolshaya Nikitskaya, printed by I. N. Kushnerov and Company, \nPimenov Street, entrance from the courtyard; the courtyard is not \npaved; mud is all over. From the carriage that had arrived, two \nprinters in aprons, soiled with God only knows what, push paper rolls directly into the puddle. The splashes created by the \nfallen rolls greatly amuse the workers. Having been splattered, \none after another the bales keep rolling along the courtyard, \ngetting wrapped into a finger-thick layer of loamy slush. Noticing the mischief and ruination from the third-story window, \nabove the arch, St. Petersburg typesetter Nikodim Yermolaich \nPalamakhterov, great-grandfather of Yakov Ilyich, dispatched \nspecially to Moscow on business of the book publishing company Enlightenment, located on the Nevsky, opens the window and curses the lads at the top of his lungs. In front of us \nstands a dandyish, slightly too elegant subject who was able to \nchange his travel clothes into the apparel appropriate for a visitor (he is wearing a fashionable wool combo and a fashionable, \nbut not excessively so, cravat) and who dropped in this morning to see his old acquaintance and colleague, employed here \nat Kushnerov’s, and who is not in his office now—he went out, \nbut will be right back, will just give the order to start in two \ncolors, will collect the proofs and ask for the samovar to be \nbrought in; good point, after all, mein Hertz, one can not keep \ngulping only Entre-Deux-Mers. Having heard above their \nheads the thunderous words of the visiting Zeus, the printers, \nwhom we left below, attempt to drop all the paper cargo in a \ndifferent place, which they consider dry, soiling themselves \nand the rolls even more than before; at the same time the \nmovements of the printers are extremely chaotic and force one \nto think about the newly discovered apparatus of Monsieur \nLumière, who acquired the patent last year and—according to \nrumors—already received a pretty centime for his invention, \nnamed by someone’s brilliant mind a cinematograph. Attracted \nby the noise, the constable, a good friend of the typesetter from \nMoscow, and, in a way, also of the one from the capital, enters \nthe courtyard from the street. Displaying his yellow aiguillettes, rattling with his spurs, and huffing under his mustache, \nhe ascends the back stairs, unfortunately, quite greasy; in boots, \nwider than tall, but a fantastic cardplayer, skirt-chaser, not a \ncomplete fool in matters of drinking, with a saber—and altogether a great chap. Bah, Ksenofont Ardalyonych—seeing him \nfilling the door, our visitor exclaims a greeting—it has been ages! \nMuch, much water flowed by, Nikodim Yermolaich, Ksenofont Ardalyonych replies, advancing with his hands stretched \nout for an embrace. What brings You here? And since Nikodim \nYermolaich sits down on one, hence Ksenofont Ardalyonych \nsits down on the other stylish Viennese mahogany chair, \nwhich, purchased by the company for nine and a half rubles in \nassignations, mercilessly cracks during this cruel ordeal, and \nthe continuing inseparability of its parts for a moment appears \nto the zealous enlightener quite problematic. However, the \nalarm turns out to be false and the maker-up, relieved, releases \na stupendous cloud of smoke that gives Ksenofont Ardalyonych a reason to show interest in what club his friend is registered right now, and also in the type of the tobacco smoked by \nNikodim Yermolaich: Do You prefer Havanas? It turns out that \nfor the last three years Nikodim Yermolaich has had an honor \nto be a member of the Jockey Club, and it is a rare week that he \nis not at the hippodrome. And as far as the tobacco is concerned—Yes, You guessed, the same, manufactured in Bremen. \nSuper-pleasant, not only the extraordinary lightness but also \nambré, and whatever You would wish for. And look how convenient, everything’s already precut. Most obliged, but we’re still \npuffing the Asmolov smokes like before. Ah, excuse my \nstraightforwardness, You disregard them in vain, after all, You \nknow, Ptolomey Dorofeich himself gives them praise. Really? \nYou must be kidding! Why would I be kidding, my dearest \nKsenofont Ardalyonych? I and Ptolomey Dorofeich are like \nYou and I now—namely, he is a liberal of the most unusual \ndisposition, even though, supposedly, a Mason and, as they \nsay, not the last figurant in the lodge. What? To lie, Ksenofont \nArdalyonych, I do not have reasons—I sell it for as much as I \nbought it, and as far as the Havanas, do not even bother doubting, I personally offered him a light more than once. How \ncome, do You attend his jour fixes? I am not an amateur of unreasonable modesty, the man from Petersburg answered with \nthis spontaneous dignity that nowadays cannot be found not \nonly in unimportant but also in very important individuals, I \ndo not hold it as my principle. Not only jour fixes, he continued, aim higher; I am an insider even at his benefits. From \nthere they went more briskly. Beyond the windows, the signs \nof the major prospects sped by; on the Palace Square, splashing with the slush the portly policeman from toes to head, the \ncharabanc of chatter turned and, having flashed with its spokes, \nshot out onto the Nevsky—it sped by the salons and restaurants, by mirrored shop windows and façades worth millions. \nThey chatted about the new Buhre clock and about African Boers, they agreed that the former ticks too loudly and the latter, \neven though boorish bandits, are quite bold—and do not \njudge so you will not be judged. At the same time they recalled \nthe trial and judgment of the robbers of the Swiss bank and the \nrecent major robbery of the Colorado train, and Ksenofont \nArdalyonych did not fail to stick a pin into the Americans: Eh, \nwhat bashi-bazouks, he complained. As soon as they started \ntalking about bashi-bazouks proper who, during the last campaign, seized about a hundred of our blunderbusses, bazookas, \nand other muzzle-loaders, and in a barbaric way harquebussed \nthe captured cuirassiers and cavalier guards; as soon as they \ntouched upon the sad topic of the dozen unfortunate quartermasters and orderlies from the uhlan and artillery ranks that \nwere taken hostage and later drowned on the captured French \nfelucca sailing under an Italian flag and blown up near Balaklava \nby a Turkish torpedo; as soon as they had mentioned all this, \nwhen, burdened by a stack of galley proofs, the resident head \nmaker-up finally entered the office. On the man who came in, \nbesides the unclean lace-ups from Ehrlich, the untidy appearance of which only affirms the business acumen of their owner, \nthe reader discovers pinstripe pants and a frock coat. Nikodim \nYermolaich, why are You—he barks out straight from the \nthreshold and with a slight reproach, after only exchanging bows \nwith the constable—why are You screaming like a Jericho trumpet; it can be heard as far as the typesetting hall. Have mercy, \nIgnaty Varfolomeich—the enlightener excuses himself—but \nshould they be allowed to bathe in puddles such first-rate paper? \nBe so kind, take a look. All three—Ksenofont Ardalyonych, \nNikodim Yermolaich, and Ignaty Varfolomeich—approach the \nwindow. Yessiree, bellevue, what else is there to say—the guardian of order concludes, having glanced at what is going on in \nthe courtyard—and yet, paving would do no harm. But how—the typographer complains—who would give us money for \nsuch trifles, under the present circumstances? Well, allow me \nto express my curiosity, dear sir, what displeases You in our \ncircumstances; moreover, what are You publishing here—pointing to the proofs, the police official continues his interrogation—proclamations? Give me a break, brother—the disheartened maker-up comes up with a rebuke, handing his \ninterlocutor one of the printed sheets. Having scanned several \nlines, the uniform of the heavenly color falls into unfeigned \nagitation: Wow, just listen, gentlemen, what kind of appetizing \ndisguise has been observed in a certain Brazilian hunting spider, living on oranges! Brazilian? Nikodim Yermolaich asks \nwith curiosity so genuine that one would think he spent his \nentire life on this subject. Its cephalothorax, Ksenofont Ardalyonych quotes, turned transparent white, like paraffin, \nwhile its porcelain-white abdomen sprouts seven fingerlike, \norange-colored growths, representing stamens of the orange \nblossom. Hidden under this magical attire, the constable continues reading, the spider successfully performs its deadly \ndeeds. Just think, my friends, what a rascal! Shocking, the \nguest  from the Neva anxiously agrees, I am at a loss for \nwords. And also note, Ksenofont Ardalyonych widens the excursus, that among the humpbacked crickets we find several \nspecies that to an illusion resemble the curved-back thorns \ngrowing on the branches of Leguminosae inhabited by them. \nAnd the bird’s eye? The host’s question is so unexpected and \nseems so contradictory to the general tone of the conversation \nthat Ksenofont Ardalyonych and Nikodim Yermolaich are \nstartled, as if someone suddenly fired a montechristo. Do You \nknow, Ignaty Varfolomeich orated in the meantime, are You \naware, esteemed gentlemen, what the bird’s eye is? I know better what a bread pie is, ruffled up like a sparrow, the visiting \npolygraphist rushes forward with a pun. Well, should we not \nassume, the constable dares to enter the conversation, that the \nbird’s eye, speaking, of course, roughly, is nothing else but the \neye, permit me to say, of a bird, even if quite small. Fiddlesticks, \nIgnaty Varfolomeich, a bilious and highly egotistic person altogether, condescendingly replies; the name of the bird’s eye, the \ntypesetter triumphantly announces, is given to the kind of \nbirch burl, which is so rare, and for this reason also expensive, \nthat the doors made of it in the train cars of His Imperial Majesty are priced at one hundred seventy rubles each. Ksenofont \nArdalyonych and Nikodim Yermolaich were literally thrown \noff their positions. They got confused to such a degree that for \na moment became Ksenofont Yermolaich and Nikodim Ardalyonych: The mentioned number mightily mesmerizes the \nopponents of Ignaty Varfolomeich. And God only knows how \nlong their confusion would have lasted if the porter Avdey, a \nsleepy peasant with a pitch-black beard reaching up to his dull \nand birdlike tiny eyes and with a similarly dull metal badge, did \nnot come to say to the master that they should not be angry—the samovar completely broke and that is why there will be no \ntea, but, say, if needed, there is plenty of fresh beer, brought on \na pledge from the cabbie, one should only procure a deed of purchase, and if in addition to beer they had wished to have some \nsinging girls, they should send a courier to the Yar right away. \nEh, brother, You are, methinks, not a total oaf, the policeman \naddresses the sentinel—and soon the table cannot be recognized. The prints and typesets are gone. In their place stand \nthree mugs with beer, being filled, in keeping with their depletion, from a medium-size barrel that, with obvious importance, \ntowers above the modest, but not lacking in refinement, selection of dishes: oysters; some anchovies; about a pound and a \nhalf of unpressed caviar; sturgeon’s spine—not tzimmes but \nalso not to be called bad; and about three dozen lobsters. The \nGypsies are late. Waiting for them, the companions arranged a \ngame of lotto, and none else but Ksenofont Ardalyonych \nshouts out the numbers. Seventy-seven, he shouts out. A match \nmade in heaven, rhymes Palamakhterov, even though he has \nno match. Forty-two! We have that too, the man from Petersburg assures, although again his numbers do not correspond. \nDeception of Nikodim Yermolaich is as petty as it is obvious, \nand as outsiders we are quite embarrassed for him; but the pretending of Yakov Ilyich stands out black on white. Possessing \nfrom his birth the enchanting gift of artistic contemplation, \nbut being both shy and frail, now and then he tried not to attract attention to the fact that he was the one whom he, naturally, simply was not able not to be, since he possessed what he \npossessed. For that reason, probably, Yakov Ilyich’s attempts \nturned into complete blunders and consequently led not to the \ndesirable but to undesirable results, again and again drawing to \nthe gifted youngster uninterrupted, although not always favorable attention of the crowd. Do you remember how once, long \nago, he let his mind wander, and a gust of the April chiller did \nnot wait with ripping off the skullcap from his proudly carried \nhead? It is really not important that the street, as ill luck would \nhave it, teeming with concerned well-wishers, kept admonishing the hero, warning: Pick it up, you will catch a cold! Ostentatiously ignoring the shouts, taking care not to look back, and \narrogantly not stopping but turning the pedals forward and—cynically and flippantly chirring with the spokes, the chain, \nand the cog of free wheel—backward, attempting to present \neverything as if he had nothing to do with it, he continued riding, the way he definitely wanted it to be seen through the eyes \nof the side spectator, with melancholic detachment. But, you \nknow, a certain superfluous stooping that unexpectedly appeared for an instant in the entire subtle look of the courier \n(exactly like his great-grandfather, his grandfather used to say), \ndiminished, even nullified his efforts to make his bodily movements carefree, froze them, made them childishly angular and \nexposed the daydreaming errand boy, with his feeble straighthaired head, to the curses of the mob: Scatterbrain, dimwit—the street carped and hooted. And if it were, let us suppose, not \nsimply a slouching, chirring courier but a real humpbacked \ncricket from Patagonia, then, with such a mediocre ability not \nto attract attention, it would have been immediately pecked \napart. But, fortunately, it was precisely a courier—a messenger-thinker, a painter-runner, an artist-carrier, and the nagging \nfeeling that everything in our inexplicable here takes place and \nexists only supposedly did not leave him that evening even for \na moment. That is how, either absentmindedly looking through \nthe window or paging in the diffused light of a smoldering \nlamp through Carus Sterne—once respectable and solid, but \nnow thinned, reduced by smoking and bodily urges, and yet \neven now adequately representing the sole volume of this \nmodest home library—Yakov Ilyich Palamakhterov, the incorruptible witness and whipper-in of his practical and unforgiving time, philosophized and speculated.\n",

  content: "Яков Ильич Паламахтеров (вот, кстати, его Автопортрет в мундире; а впрочем, стоит ли переписывать такие внушительные полотна, не имея к этому сколько-нибудь заметных способностей и наперед понимая, что посетитель лишь мельком взглянет на копию как \nна скучнейшую здесь деталь, дабы немного спустя, все более забываясь и путая действительное и воображаемое, уверять себя то \nи знай: да, так, именно так все и было; и, оценивая себя со стороны \nили в зеркале, оставаться совершенно довольным своими — то есть \nнет, погодите, его, конечно, его, героя, поступками и чертами; перемалевывать автопортреты в мундирах — увольте), Яков Ильич Паламахтеров порывался не подавать виду. Напрасно. Трудно вообразить себе человека, который в своем неумении мимикрировать менее напомнил бы бразильского охотничьего паука или горбатых \nпатагонских сверчков — см. Карус Штерне, Эволюцiя Mipa, Werden \nund Vergehen, Перевод с немецкаго, Том III, Издательство товарищества Mip, Москва, Большая Никитская, 22, Типографiя товарищества И. Н. Кушнерова и Ко, Пименовская улица, со двора, во дворе \nнемóщено, грязь. С подъехавшей повозки двое типографских в фартуках, вымазанных невесть чем, спихивают прямо в лужу бумажные \nрулоны. Порождаемыя их паденiем брызги немало забавляют работников. Ополоснувшись, рулоны один за другим раскатываются по \nдвору, одеваясь дюймовым слоем суглинистой жижи. Заметив безобразие и разор из окна, что в третьем этаже, над аркой, отворяет фортку и на всю Елоховскую бранит молодцов направленный в Москву \nнарочно по делам книгоиздательскаго товарищества Просвещенiе, \nчто на Невском, петербуржскiй метранпаж Никодим Ермолаич Паламахтеров, прадед Якова Ильича. Перед нами — щеголеватый, \nнемного слишком изящный субъект, успевшiй сменить дорожное на \nприличествующее визитеру платье (он в модной чесучовой паре \nи модном же, хоть и не чересчур, галстухе) и завернувшiй нынче \nс утра к своему давнишнему знакомцу и коллеге, который служит \nтут, у Кушнерова, и коего в кабинете теперь нет — вышел, но ciю \nминуту будет назад, скажет только, чтоб начинали уж в две краски, \nзаберет корректуру да велит самовар принесть: право слово, не все \nж, майн херц, д’антр-де-мер дуть. Заслышав над головою громовыя \nречи заезжаго Зевеса, типографскiе, оставленные нами внизу, принимаются скатывать всю бумагу в иное, каковое они полагают сухим, место, еще более прежняго вымарывая себя и рулоны, причем \nдвиженья печатников до крайности суетны и принуждают вас думать об новоявленном аппарате мусье Люмьера, взявшаго в прошлом году патент и — по слухам — выручившаго за изобретенье свое, \nполучившее с чьей-то легкой руки чуднóе прозванье синематографа, пристойную уже копейку. Завлеченный шумом, заходит с улицы во двор, изволит желтеть аксельбантами, побрякивать шпорами \nи, покрякивая в усы, воздыматься по черной, к несчастью довольно \nзасаленной, лестнице, околоточный, добрый прiятель московскаго, \nа некоторым образом и столичнаго метранпажей; в сапогах, поперек \nсебя шире, зато отменный картежник, ветреник, не круглый дурак \nвыпить, при сабле — и вообще славный малый. Ба, Ксенофонт Ардальоныч, — завидев его застрявшим в дверях, восклицает ему навстречу наш визитер, — сколько лет! Много, много воды утекло, Никодим Ермолаич, возражал Ксенофонт Ардальоныч, шествуя встреч \nтому с распахнутыми объятьями, какими судьбами? И поскольку \nНикодим Ермолаич присаживается на один, постольку Ксенофонт \nАрдальоныч присаживается на другой венскiй изящный краснаго дерева стул, который, будучи приобретен товариществом за 9 р. \nс полтиною ассигнацiями, немилосердно трещит при этом жестоком \nиспытанiи, отчего дальнейшая целокупность частей его на мгновенiе воображается рачительному просвещенцу довольно проблематичной. Однако тревога оказывается как будто ложной, и метранпаж облегченно выпускает из себя отменный клуб дыма, что дает \nКсенофонт Ардальонычу повод заинтересоваться, членом котораго \nклуба записан нынче его приятель, а заодно и сортом табаку, куримаго Никодим Ермолаичем: гаванскiя предпочитаете? Выясняется, \nчто третiй год Никодим Ермолаич имеет честь состоять в жокейском и редкую неделю не посещает гипподрома. Что же до табаку, \nто — угадали, оне самыя, в Бремене фабрикованы. Преприятственныя — и легкость необыкновенная, и амбре, и все, что желаете. Да \nвот, не угодно ли, уж и обрезано. Благодарствуйте, мы по старинке \nпахитосками асмаловскими попыхиваем. Ах, напрасно вы, извините за прямоту, пренебрегаете, их ведь, знаете ли, сам Птоломей Дорофеич похваливает. Неужто, полноте! Вот вам и неужто; я, любезнейшiй Ксенофонт Ардальоныч, с Птоломей Дорофеичем, как нынче с вами — то есть необыкновеннейшаго разбору души либерал; \nхотя и масон якобы, и, сказывают, не последняя фигурацiя в ложе. \nКак! Лгать, Ксенофонт Ардальоныч, основанiй не имею — за что \nкупил, за то и продаю, а насчет гаванских и сомневаться не беспокойтесь, сам не единожды огню ему подносил. Вы что же, и на журфиксах у него? Скромничать попусту я, сударь, не любитель, отвечал петербуржец с тем непринужденным достоинством, коего сплошь \nда рядом не встретишь не токмо у незначительных, но и у весьма \nзначительных у нас лиц, не держу в правилах. Что журфиксы, отвечал он, забирайте выше, я там и на бенефисах свой чело век. Тут \nпоехали шибче. За окнами уносились таблички самоглавнейших \nпрошпектов; на Дворцовой, с ног до головы обдав слякотью громаднаго городоваго, шарабан раздобара развернулся и, спицами зарябив в очах, вылетел единым махом на Невский — летел вдоль салонов и ресторацiй, мимо зеркальных витрин и миллiонных фасадов. \nБолтали о новых часах Буре и об африканских бурах, сошлись на \nтом, что первые слишком тикают, а вторые хоть и бандиты, да молодцы — и не судите да не судимы будете. Заодно воспомнили о суде над ограбителями швейцарскаго банка и о новом крупном ограбленiи колорадскаго поезда, причем Ксенофонт Ардальоныч не \n преминул вставить шпильку американцам: ох уж эти мне башибузуки, посетовал он. Едва заговорили о собственно башибузуках, захвативших в последнюю кампанию до сотни наших гаковниц, базук \nи протчих пищалей и варварски аркебузировавших плененных кирасиров и кавалергардов, едва коснулись до грустной темы о дюжине несчастных квартирмейстеров и вестовых из улан и от канонирскаго состава, взятых заложниками и потонувших на трофейной \nфранцузской фелуке, шедшей под италiанским стягом и подорванной под Балаклавой турецкой петардой, едва упомянули обо всем \nэтом, как в кабинете, обремененный целым бунто́м гранок, является \nнаконец здешнiй главный верстальщик. На вшедшем, кроме нечищеных от Эрлиха штиблет, коих неухоженность свидетельствует \nлишь в пользу деловых качеств владельца, читатель обнаруживает \nпанталоны со штришками и сюртук. Чего это вы, Никодим Ермолаич, прямо с порога и несколько с упреком, только отшаркавшись \nс околоточным, бросает он, чего это вы как iерихонская труба вопите, даже в наборном слыхать. Помилуйте, Игнатiй Варфоломеич, \nоправдывается просвещенец, вольно ж им первостатейную бумагу \nв лужах купать, благоволите свидетельствовать. Все трое — Ксенофонт Ардальоныч да Никодим Ермолаич с Игнатiй Варфоломеичем — следуют к нише. Да-с, бельвю, нечего сказать, заключает блюститель порядка, глянув на происходящее во дворе, а ведь и замостить бы не грех. Куда, сетует типографщик, кто это вам на подобные \nпустяки деньги даст, в настоящих-то обстоятельствах. А позвольтека полюбопытствовать, милостивый государь, чем это вам наши \nобстоятельства не показались; и потом, вы что же, кивая на гранки, \nпродолжает дознанiе полицейскiй чин, прокламации изволите публиковать? Будет вам, батенька, укорял обескураженный метранпаж, \nпротягивая собеседнику один из листов. Пробежав несколько строк, \nмундир небеснаго цвета впадает в неподдельную ажитацiю: нет, вы \nтолько послушайте, господа, какую аппетитную маскировку наблюдали у однаго бразильскаго охотничьяго паука, живущаго на апельсинах! Бразильскаго? — с любопытством настолько живым, что, \nмыслится, едва ли не весь живот его сошелся на сем предмете, переспрашивает Никодим Ермолаич. Головогрудь его, цитирует Ксенофонт Ардальоныч, стала прозрачно-белой, как парафин, в то время \nкак фарфорово-белое брюшко выпускает семь пальцевидных оранжевых выростов, изображающих тычинки померанцеваго цветка. Под \nэтим сказочным одеянием, читает далее околоточный, паук успешно творит свое смертоносное дело. Вы подумайте, друзья мои, что \nза шельма! Чудовищно, соглашается взволнованно невскiй гость, \nя не отыщу слов. Обратите вниманiе, ширит экскурс Ксенофонт Ардальоныч, а среди горбатых сверчков нам встречается ряд таких, \nкоторые до иллюзiи походят на загнутыя назад колючки, какiя носят на ветвях своих обитаемые ими легуминозы. А птичiй глаз? Вопрос хозяина поставлен таким ребром и глядит такою контрадикцiею к общему тону беседы, что Ксенофонт Ардальоныч с Никодим \nЕрмолаичем прямо вздрагивают, будто кто из монтекристо тут выпалил. Знаете ли вы, витiйствовал между тем Игнатiй Варфоломеич, \nизвестно ли вам, государи мои, что есть птичiй глаз? Я более знаю, \nчто есть писчiй спазм, нахохлившись воробьем, находится каламбуром прiезжiй полиграфист. Да не следует ли полагать, осмеливается \nразсуждать околоточный, что птичiй глаз, говоря, разумеется, округленно, есть не что иное, как глаз, с позволенiя выразиться, птицы, \nпусть даже и небольшой. Дудки-с, язвительно отзывается Игнатiй \nВарфоломеич, личность вообще желчная и в высшей степени самолюбивая; птичьим глазом, победительно возвещает верстальщик, \nименуется род березоваго капа, что до того редок, в силу чего и дорог, что двери из него в вагонах Его Императорскаго Величества \nпоезда оцениваются по сто семьдесят рубликов всякая. Ксенофонт \nАрдальоныч с Никодим Ермолаичем были буквально сбиты с позицiи. Они до того смешались, что на минуту сделались Ксенофонт \nЕрмолаичем и Никодим Ардальонычем: названная цифра сильнейшим образом магнетизирует оппонентов Игнатiя Варфоломеича. \nИ бог весть, сколько длилось бы их смятенiе, когда б не привратник \nАвдей, заспанный мужик с смоляной бородою до мутных и маленьких, словно бы птичьих, глаз и с мутной же бляхой, пришедшiй сказать, чтобы барин не гневались — самовар совсем прохудился и оттого чаю не выйдет, но, мол, если угодно, то имеется вволю свежайшаго пива, взятаго под залог у извозчика, купчую бы вот только \nвыправить, а ежели к пивечку певичек прикажут, то чтоб велели \nтеперь же курьера к Яру послать. Э, братец, да ты, я чай, не вовсе \nорясина, замечает соглядатаю участковый, — и вскорости стол не \nузнать. Оттиски, гарнитура — убраны. На их месте — три стклянки \nс пивом, по мере разходу пополняемыя из средних размеров бочонка, с очевидной значительностью возвышающагося посреди скромнаго, пусть и не лишеннаго изысканности выбора блюд: устрицы; \nнемного анчоусов; фунта полтора зернистой; севрюжья спинка — не \nцимес, но и невозможно упрекнуть, что дурная; да дюжины три омаров. Цыганы припаздывают. Ожидаючи их, составилась партiя в лото, и не кто иной, как Ксенофонт Ардальоныч, кричит нумера. Семьдесят восемь, кричит он. Милости просим, рифмует Паламахтеров, \nхоть и не выпало. Сорок шесть. И это есть, уверяет петербуржец, \nхоть у него снова не корреспондирует. Притворство Никодим Ермолаича столь мелочно, сколь и очевидно, и мы как-то вчуже конфузимся за Никодим Ермолаича; лукавство же Якова Ильича и вовсе \nшито белыми нитками. От рожденья владея пленительным даром \nхудожнической созерцательности, но будучи и застенчив, и деликатен, он то и знай порывался не подавать виду, что он таков, каким, \nестественно, просто не мог не быть, коль скоро владел тем, чем владел. Оттого-то, наверное, порывы Якова Ильича и оборачивались \nсплошными неловкостями и в этом виде вели не к желаемому, а к нежелаемому результату, лишнiй раз приковывая к одаренному юноше неотрывное, пусть и не всегда восторженное вниманье толпы. \nПомните, как однажды, давным-давно, он опять зазевался, а порыв \nапрельскаго свежака не замедлил сорвать ермолку с его тщеславно \nпосаженной головы? Что за важность, что улица, как назло кишевшая участливыми сердоболами, уличала героя, грозя: подберите, \nпростынете! Он, подчеркнуто игнорируя окрики, тщательно не оборачиваясь, горделиво не оставляя вращать педали вперед и — цинически легкомысленно стрекоча шестеренками, цепью и храповиком \nхолостаго хода — назад, попытался тем самым представить все дело \nтак, словно не имеет к нему никакого касательства, и не прекращал \nразъезжать — как ему непременно хотелось видеть глазами сторонняго наблюдателя — меланхолически непричастно. Но знаете, некоторая избыточная сутуловатость, неожиданно засквозившая во всем \nсубтильном (весь в прадеда, говаривал ему дед) обличие разъезднаго, умалила, даже свела на нет его хлопоты о беззаботности телодвиженiй, сковала, сделала их по-мальчишески угловатыми и выдала \nротозея-разсыльнаго с его тщедушной простоволосой башкой на \nпоруганiе черни: раззява, разиня — уличала и улюлюкала улица. \nИ если бы то был, предположим, не просто сутуловатый стрекочущiй разъездной, а настоящiй горбатый сверчок Патагонiи, то при \nстоль же неважных способностях не подавать виду он был бы немедленно склеван. Но к счастью, то был как раз разъездной — разъездной созерцатель, посыльный художник, курьерский артист, и щемящее ощущенiе, что все вокруг в нашем неразрешимом здесь происходит и существует лишь якобы, не оставляло его в означенный \nвечер ни на минуту. Так, разсеянно посматривая в окно или при \nразсеянном свете коптилки полистывая Каруса Штерна — некогда \nпредставительнаго, солиднаго, а теперь отощавшаго, траченнаго курительными и бытовыми порывами, но и поныне достойно собой \nпредставлявшаго единственный том этой скромной домашней библiотеки, — философствовал и формулировал Яков Ильич Паламахтеров, неподкупный свидетель и доезжачiй своего практическаго \nи безжалостнаго времени.\n",

  content: "With what does the station’s waitin room wallop us tactlessly on the nose? Don’t consider \nit a complaint, but in its mass the public stinks \nlike a wet and homeless dog. Our armpits started hurtin from \nice-covered roads, migraine blurred our eyes. Due to fatigue, \nwe visit a railroad drinkin hole—we’re takin medicine. I asked \nAlfeyev, where are you goin now? He considers: Mother Russia \nis huge, playful, and she barks like a she-wolf in the fog, and \nwe, like flies, hop on the top of her, and she bites us out one \nafter another as we hop, and it’s impossible to figure out where \nit would be best to jump off, halloo, ever. True, Yasha, halloo, \nin our radiant country we’re all like a bone stuck in its throat, \nwe’re all debtors, we’re all at fault. And my real mother, he said, \nperhaps died, and I’m lackin a permanent father ’cuz of alcoholism; I only heard he was called Ilya. Yasha, my dear, perhaps I am he, perhaps there happened some kids in a hurry, \nafter all, life is also huge. I allow that, answered Ilyich, but if it’s \nso, why did you completely abandon my mother, did not help \nthe woman get her son on his feet, did not give him a vocational education; after all that, you are a rat for me and not dad. \nAnd he got offended. Yakov Ilyich, I cheered him up, stop bein \ncross, perhaps I am no father of yours at all, calm down a bit, \ndo not get too excited, do not. Excuse me, he says, I blew my \ntop, perhaps you ain’t my father. But it’s possible, I am hangin \non contrariwise, it’s possible that precisely your father, who \nknows? Therefore, let me be not simply a father but a possible-father, I will be a possible-father to you. Be so, uttered Alfeyev, \nwhy should I care? In that case, I take the lad on his word, you \ncould lend me, such an inexact dad of yours, money for a ticket \nwithout a reserved seat: Gimme an advance, I need to get to the \nTower Junction, to a certain Joy Whatshername. Don’t refuse \nthe request, help the old man, ain’t you his flesh and blood, \nperhaps? Yakov Ilyich sheds crocodile tears at the train station: \nDaddy, Ilyusha, prodigerant, you’re gettin ready to see our \nmother, even if she’s no longer among the livin, perhaps. I got \nconfused: Why her exactly? ’Cuz, he says, she also worked at \nthe station. And what about her last name, first name, and initials in general? Well, I don’t give a darn about them initials, he \nscreamed, whatever they might be, why are you goin on like a \nstranger of little faith? And he bought me a ticket to the Tower \nJunction. For farewell we hugged, smooched—so take care, we \nwon’t see each other, the huge she-wolf is spread far and wide. \nAnd he gave me substantial notes; I received them, crumpled \nthem, stashed them in my valenok—and adieu. I am ridin on \nthe train, broodin: You’re a miserable wretch, Yakov Ilyich, \nan orphan, your father is a swindler, a rapscallion, he did not \nhelp your mother at all, and the latter was of easy virtue, and \nthere is, very likely, hardly a spot to put a proof of purity on her, \neven if she ain’t the one Whatshername. Those from the Tower \nJunction, they are all nothin but fine broads—whether this \none or the twelfth, but, anyway, I am goin to this one, ’cuz the \ntwelfth I don’t freakin need. That’s what I was thinkin about my \nrelatives, languishin in the pitiful car with no reserved seats, \namidst all the others afflicted, like me, by poverty. And it was \nrockin on switches. Roll up your eyelids like a pant leg, bare \nyour stump, too—so it is more spectacular—and scoot to the \ncar with reserved seats: Your instrument’s with you. Immediately start a melody and announce over the knockin and dancin \nof the wheels that you know no peace, and don’t have any joy \neither—you suffered a misfortune. And after that esplain what \nhappened. But don’t be concerned about nourishment, don’t \nbeg for Christ’s sake, don’t moan and don’t groan, and, speakin \nheart-to-heart, carry high the lofty name of the folk invalidual, \nsince even the most horriblest of us is better than fowls of the \nair. And those who get emotional—they will loosen their purse \nstrings on their own. So you begin the concert. I will stretch a \nspool of thread to the green lea’s end, or I’ll pound a telegram to \nmy dearest friend. Here it is, the much-beloved Russian song; \nit flows and splashes all over the premises—and the journey \nis long. And from where, You’ll inquire, do you, Ilya, have an \nacordeon, have you sold some manure, Your Lameness? No, I \nhaven’t sold any manure and such an extraordinary dough, to \nbuy the music, I haven’t ever held in my hands out of principle. But our real world does not befall us without such generous \nsouls as our orderly. They brought to Uncle Vanya at the theater an artist from the outskirts, a victim of dangerous razors, \nin a tilted cap and with a gold tooth. And he was, apparently, \nsuch a passionate musician that even his kirza boots were like \nan acordeon. At the same time his three-row instrument was \nbrought along with him. The male nurse credited the account \non behalf of the poor, but, he used to say, the bandura appears \nto be of no use: Whenever I try to play, right away it becomes \nclear I don’t know how: either my hands are shakin or my voice \nbreaks up. But I, I kept promisin, I know how, just let me. They \nhanded it over. How I pulled the bellows, how I worked out a \nfingerin on them pimples! Now play somethin ours, the orderly \nimplores, yank away! Once the boozin started, I whipped chastushkas at a full swing. Crematorium they were tryin, homeless \nvagrant they were fryin (the management’s so shrewd), they \nlook in—and he is teasin: Close the door, my butt is freezin. \nWhoever was present there in the cellar broke into a crazy \ndance, and look, even Yakov Ilyich on his one and only makes \na freak of himself. Uncle Vanya also bends his knees and I hear, \nas if in a heavenly swoon: I see, I see, you can, here’s the hurdy-gurdy for you from my white shoulder.\n\nAnd in trains they simply could not stop praisin me. One courier even called me to his compartment: Let me pour you a \ndrink. Ain’t You disgusted hobnobbin with me? Phew, he \nlaughs, I used to gobble from the common bowl with worse \nthan you. And he pours. Why are You temptin me, citizen, \nwhat if I don’t hold back? Be so kind, go ahead. And he’s completely bare, like a cantaloupe. I gulped. And he goes: At a train \nstation there sat a soldier, a rake and dandy, brother-in-arms, \njust a lieutenant by rankin order, but a field marshal of female \ncharms. I am a brainy bayan player, I made up a melody for him \non the fly, in two-fourths. A certain madam entered the station, \nand she was serious, graceful, and neat; lieutenant quickly \nstood at attention and dropped his breeches straight at her feet. \nAnd a chorus. And I, too, said my travelin companion, was a \nlieutenant, like in the song. I wore cartridge belts and a mustache, but due to my manners and my rank, I was registered as \na deputy. But not of some railroad female charms, no, in my license I was registered as a deputy inspector of all cast-iron \nroads. And he pours me, just imagine, Armenian delight. You \nmust have lost Your mind, to waste three stars on a person with \nno passport. And he only sparkles with his buttons. And for \nthat reason, he admits, the railroad destiny is dear to me, I got \nused to it, I’m ashamed to say, I love, excuse me, scrambled \neggs and tearin at full speed in an express rushin on. And where \ndo you think I am goin right now? Don’t be angry, I answered, \nI have no clue about Your travel plans, so far I am not buyin \nYour tickets. So far others are buyin tickets for Ilya. Do you \nthink that I planned to visit for a while my brother in Kazan?—the lieutenant kept questionin. Who knows what You do, I personally would gladly go to visit my brother out of the blue, and \nthen enjoy yourself as much as you like, eat-drink-sleep. If you \nget bored, you can call to a get-together the neyborly Musia or \nyou can wander with a dragnet for a while. You wander like \nthat, You know, up to your waist in water, and the slimy clay \nkeeps squeezin like leeches between your toes, it even curls. \nI get your drift, the inspector nods; frankly, my own brother is \na drunk. What can I say, deputy, a brother—a brother is there, \nbut he doesn’t send me lately any invitations, and what’s goin \non with him, I have no clue: Did he get married, is he sick, or is \nhe clinkin with his irons somewhere? No need to guess, he answered, obviously with them. But, to be honest, lieutenant, I \ndon’t recall that he scribbled to me particularly often; no, not \noften did he scribble to me, even to express it better—he never \nwrote to me at all. In irons you won’t do much writin, the lieutenant kept noddin, in the environs of Kandalaksha. Yes, and, \nYou see, it’s unlikely that I would put my head on a choppin \nblock for You to prove that this brother exists anywhere at all; \nI suspect that he’s not present in my inventory, regrettably—neither in Kazan and Ryazan, nor in Syzran. Well, then, he says, \nallow me, I will pour you for that again. And both of us took a \nswig. And the train speeds on with widely open orbs, cuts the \nyoung night like a sharp speed skate, shines into a distance \nsomewhere with a pair of manul’s eyes. In the scraps of the \nsame night dozes, quietly snoozin, snuggled like a needle in a \nhaystack, the transit passenger after surgery, like I, and to him \nthe train seems to have a completely unearthly destination. \nWoe is me, old chap, the inspector sighed, in Syzran my relatives don’t live right now, in contrast, in Millerovo, please—in \nMillerovo there’s a full assorti; incidently, my godsister passed \naway there not long ago. And he introduces himself: Yemelyan \nZhizhirella. Holy crap, I declared. And immediately embraced \nhim, fatso, and he me, a humble stick. And we drained one for \nBruderschaft. So why didn’t you write to me, I reproached, you \ncould’ve at least dropped me a postcard; and you dare to call \nyourself a onewomber. Don’t get mad so quickly, he esplained, \nI had no time to write letters in the environs of Kandalaksha, in \nthe slammer, better tell me, why do you forget your relatives: \nFor example, durin the wake in Millerovo I don’t recall seein \nyou at all, hadn’t you received the news? As far as receivin is \nconcerned, I did receive it, by hand delivery. Right away, I grab \nmy cap, catch the droshky—and to the station. I run up to a \nformidable one with a saber: What’s where here? He points \nout. And the saber has a little wheel at the bottom, to drag it \nmore smoothly. Miss, be so kind, a ticket with a reserved seat to \nMillerovo. A saber like that is stronger than a bullet, ’cuz sooner \nor later the lead will get flattened, but from the steel you won’t \nwiggle out at any price, from this here steel. At the platform— \nhigh culture: spittoons and a kiosk. Eighteen minutes. And uncertainty seized me. When I arrive—there will be no end to \ngossip, they’ll imagine, most likely, who knows what. They \nhave no clue, my skinflint kinsfolk, that not everybody is necessarily a cheapskate. Ilya does not need what’s someone else’s, \nhe doesn’t even have what’s his own, but try and esplain. You \ncan choke on your wake, I won’t go. I am standin. Here the \nconductor sounds the boardin, there the wagon usher curses, \nand over there an old lady knocks like a moth against a window \nglass: Dimka, her grandson, be so kind to notice, is departin to \nvisit his uncle in Uglich. Watch out, my urchin, don’t go walkin \nin the heat without mittens. You yourself, skinny worm, keep \nboth eyes open, otherwise someone may prematurely shake \noff your dust. Well, old man, I address the chief, are we doin the \ndeparture? And why are You intrested?—he pulled his railroad \ncap on his brow. I answer that for me it doesn’t really matter, \nthat I would like to ask about somethin else, and the departure \nitself doesn’t bother me from any side, that—who cares about \ndeparture, go on, depart. About what else?—he teases. Have \nYou ever been present at trottin competitions? It’s not the right \nword—present, I loitered there, I used to lose big sums on wagers. So You must remember how the hippodrome was burnin \nand the sparks were flyin, right? How could I not remember, \nthey kept flyin, at first there were even plans to cancel the heat. \nThere were plans, but the deal fizzled off—and the horses \nstarted traversin. From the very start, I remember, Polykleitus, \nthe black three-year-old from Polytechnician and Kleptomania, \njumped forward, but the mare Sour Cream reached the second \nturn first, and Polykleitus dropped to the third, and who was \nridin him at the moment—my memory broke the loop. Well, if \nit broke then it broke, said the railman, but we better finish \nnow with them horses, ’cuz to interrupt the departure, bein elderly, does not become You. You’re puttin on much air, old \nman, why don’t You, instead of ringin the bell, quickly deal us a \nhand? Right then, the saber rolls in: What’s up? Well, this—the \ndepartee proposes to deal a hand. Well, delay won’t make it \nrusty, it’s not a little wheel, we only need to procure unmarked \ncards. Just wait with the cards, he’s simply tryin to interrupt the \ndeparture. Have mercy, the gard flew into a rage; this is simply \nespionage of some kind. Don’t chastise, it won’t happen again, \nYou understand, Your bell brought past thoughts to my mind, \none was hangin at the races before the fire—like two peas in a \npod. It clinked and clanked—and started rollin irrepressibly. \nIn those twisted years, I had with me, even though personally \nI don’t believe it today, a commendable suitcase of crocodile \nleather. By the way, why twisted? Years like years, not more \ntwisted than the others. A suitcase of crocodile leather, I \nrepeat, with locks, in those years like years, I, Dzyndzyrella, \ndare to claim, did have. I grab it—and take to my heels. And it’s \nlashin—hard to describe. As we know, both the train and the \nrain were goin—one to Millerovo, the other all day. Dear bro, \nYemelyan declares, how great it is to ride at full speed together \nto visit you in Kazan; after all, we haven’t seen each other for so \nlong. Wait a minute, I’m gettin anxious, and did you send me a \npostalgram? Why do you ask, straight from the road. So now I \nam runnin along the embarcadero, I catch up with the train car, \nbut to jump in, due to the lack of conviction, I’m afraid. Polishin floors in all possible places in those years like years, I carried in my suitcase waxes, rags, rubbed felt, and brushes of pig \nbristle. My train usher with signal flags in cases screams his \nlungs out from the gangway: Let go, or You’ll suddenly plunge \nand make a fool of Yourself, like many others did. Linen mistress, don’t mock the passenger misfortune, go plunge Yourself. And to Yemelyan I said that, halloo—his dispatch will not \ncatch up with me and that most likely he’s hurryin to Kazan in \nvain—I will not run out. While to You, Sidor Fomich, I am \nwritin approximately what follows. One day some folk come to \nthe ferryman, and he’s sleepin soundly like a baby. Yes, this I \nunderstand, this is a riddle, ’cuz it’s a riddle and not simply a \npeasant true story. Only I don’t understand to which ferryman: \nWe have two ferrymen on the Itil. That one makes money on \nthat side, this one—on the contrary—on this one. The first, \nYeryoma nicknamed Cad; the second, in contrast, Foma, and \nwithout any nickname. He’s called respectfully by his last \nname, so why make a fuss, don’t you think? Doom—that’s the \nlast name of our boatman. And let’s suppose they come exactly \nto him: There’s work. He woke up—what kind of work? Why \nare you full of yourself for no reason, they say, as if besides ferryin you had a clue about some other trade? I won’t allow anyone to lecture me, noted Foma, you better lay out the fact. And \nthe deputy flew into a rage, stomps his feet, as if I was guilty; \neven I, the orphan, never met myself in Kazan, to tell the truth. \nWell, so where am I rushin now, the inspector shouts, tell me. \nDeputy, I draw a blank about your intricate itineraries, but if \nyou have in your hands your travel document, don’t consider \nthis disrespectful and look at it—it’s stated there. To be endlessly in trouble is Ilya Dzhynzhirela’s lot. Plunge Yourself, my \ntrain usher heard my words. I said it to him rashly—and \nplunged myself. What a mess, pal, I plunged, fell like a sack \nunder the wheels, and my bare footsie got sliced off like with a \nsickle. I see—someone familiar with a blade flies down from \nthe heavenly rafters to help. Six-winged serafim, gardian, swing \nyour yatagan once, chop off the whole me from these here \nplaces: I’m hurtin a lot, clumsy me. And the chief arrived in \ntime to scold. For You it’s nothin, he got envious, You’ve secured a sanatorium for Yourself, but people will get a reprimand on Your account. Don’t curse, after all, weather’s wet, so \none slips. A thought: Apparently the expedition failed, crashed, \nthe last rites are waitin for Ilya. And I’m in trouble again, \nwhen, smug, I advise the lieutenant to look at his ticket. You’re \na boob, he cuts me off, a deputy due to his title is not obliged to \nbuy tickets, and even when he buys sometimes, he buys a special one to any destination, and whether you look at that ticket \nor not, everythin’s a fog, and whether its presenter is goin here \nor there, nobody understands, only the ticket with the reserved \nseat flutters in the wind and a coupon for obtainin bedsheets \nrustles. Yep, you sure didn’t luck out, my countryman, but apparently not always and not everywhere deputies have advantages. It turns out that non-deputies sometimes know better \nwhere their road leads. Take me for example—to Orina, \ngimme her here and now, I’m holdin my course to her.\n",

  content: "Чем вокзал ожиданий шибает бестактно в нос? Не сочтите за \nжалобу, псиной мокрой и беспризорной преет публика в массе своей. Разболелись от гололеда у нас подмышки, замутила взоры мигрень. Навещаем с устатку путейную тут питейную — лечимся. Ты \nкуда теперь, Алфеева я спросил. Рассуждает: Россия-матерь огромна, игрива и лает, будто волчица во мгле, а мы ровно блохи скачем \nпо ней, а она по очереди выкусывает нас на ходу, и куда лучше прыгнуть, не разберешь, ау, никогда. Верно, Яша, ау, все мы у нашей \nкраи́ны светлой — как поперек горла кость, все задолжники, во всем \nкругом виноватые. А обычная мать, он сказал, у меня умерла, может \nбыть, и отца постоянного я лишен в результате алкоголизма, слышал только, величали Ильей. Яша, милый, да может, я он и есть, \nнебось случались ребятишки какие-нибудь впопыхах, жизнь же \n тоже огромна. Допускаю, Ильич отвечал, но зачем ты в подобном \nслучае мать забросил с концами, сына женщине поставить на ноги \nне помог, образования ремесленного ему не дал, подлец ты мне после этого, а не отец. И обиделся. Яков Ильич, я утешил, да ты не \nсерчай, я еще, может, и не отец тебе никакой, охолони чуток, шибко \nне кипятись, шибко-то. Извиняй, говорит, погорячился, может, и не \nотец. А возможно, обратно примазываюсь, возможно, что как раз \nи отец, неизвестно еще. И поэтому пусть я буду тебе не просто отец, \nа отец-может-быть, может-быть-отцом стану приходиться тебе. Приходись, Алфеев изрек, мне-то что. Если так, на слове парня ловлю, \nто не одолжишь ли мне, как папаше такому неточному, на билет неплацкартный: займи, мне на станцию Терем, к Отраде одной Имярековой. Просьба в денежке не отказать, выручай старика, или ты \nне плоть от плоти его, может быть. Яков Ильич при вокзале белугой \nревет: батя, Илюша, блудущий мой, ты ж к мамане нашей нагладился, пусть она у нас и не в живых, может быть. Я смешался: зачем это \nнепременно к ней? Потому, говорит, что на станции тоже работала. \nА фамилия, имя, инициалы вообще? А плевать я хотел на инициалы, \nвскричал, какие бы ни были, что ты как маловер неродной. И купил мне билет до Терема. Облокотились взаимно мы на прощанье, \nоблобызались — прощай-ка, не свидимся, преогромна волчица — \nраскинулась. Дал купюр еще он значительных, я их принял, пожамкал, затырил в валенок — и адью. Еду и маюсь: бедолага ты, Яков \nИльич, сирота, жук отец твой, пройдоха, он помощь мамашке не осуществлял ни хрена, та же — поведения облегченного, и пробы на ней \nставить — вряд ли, пожалуй, где есть, даже если и не та она Имярекова. Теремские — они ведь все оторвы приличные — что та, что \nдвенадцатая, но все-таки еду к той, потому что двенадцатая ни на́ \nболт сдалась. Так я мыслил о родственниках своих, в бесплацкартном заплаканном томясь вместе с прочими, одержимыми, как и я, нищетой. И мотало на стрелках. На манер как бы брючины подворачивай вежды себе, заголяй и культю — чтоб чудне́й, и задвигайся \nв купейный: с тобой инструмент. Заводи моментально мелодию \nи заявляй поверх пересудов и переплясов колес, что не ведаешь мира, нет и отрады — постигло несчастие. И далее поясни, в чем суть. \nОднако о пропитании не заботься, не христарадничай, не канючь \nи не клянчь, говоря задушевно, высокое звание народного индивида \nнеси высоко, ведь и самый из нас страшнеющий лучше птах. А кого \nпроймет — сам раскошелится. И начинаешь концерт. Протяну катушку ниток по зеленому лужку, отобью ли телеграмму моему милу́ \nдружку. Вот она, разлюбимая русская песнь, льется и плещется по \nвсему помещению — а путь далек. А откуда, заинтересуетесь, гармония у тебя, Илия, что ли, навоз Вы продали, Ваше Калечество? Нет, \nне продавал я навоз, и бабок столь исключительных, чтоб музыку \nприобресть, в руках не держал из принципа. Но не вершится свет \nнастоящий без таких щедрых духом, как наш санитар. Завезли к дяде Ване в театр артиста окраин, жертву опасных бритв, в кепке набок и зуб золотой. И до того музыкант, вероятно, заядлый, что сапоги у него — и те гармошкой, кирза. Заодно и трехрядка его с ним \nсам-друг доставлена. Заприходовал ее медбрат в пользу бедных, \nтолько, сказывал, предстает бандура вне надобности: как играть я попробую — так сразу и выясняется, что не умею: то руки дрожат, то \nголос срывается. А я, я сулил, я умею, лишь дайте. Вручают. Как \nдернул меха, как выработал перебор по пупырышкам! Сбацай наше \nчего-нибудь, санитар умоляет, рвани. Раз пошла таковская пьянка, \nзапузырил я частухи на полный размах. Крематорий проверяли, \nбеспризорника сжигали (дирекция какая-нибудь хитрая), дверь открыли — он танцует и кричит: закройте, ведь дует. Пляска бешеная \nих всех, кто там случился в подвале, взяла, инда Яков Ильич на одной, поглядите, уродуется. Дядя Ваня тоже коленца откалывает, \nи слышу, как в райском обмороке: вижу, вижу, могёшь, получай ты \nшарманку эту с белого моего плеча.\n\nА в поездах меня прямо захваливали. Один разъездной даже \nв купе зазвал — дай налью. А не гнушаетесь якшаться со мной? Тю, \nсмеется, еще не с такими доводилось из одного корыта хлебать. Наполняет. Что вы меня искушаете, гражданин, а ну как не вытерплю? \nСделай милость, валяй. Сам весь гунявый, как канталупа. Я опрокинул. Он выдает: на станции сидел один военный, обыкновенный \nгуляка-франт, по чину своему он был поручик, но дамских ручек \nбыл генерал. Я — баянист головитейший, мелодию ему подобрал на \nходу, в два счета. На станцию вошла весьма серьезно и грациозно \nодна мадам, поручик расстегнул свои шкарята и бросил прямо к ее \nногам. И припев. Вот и я, будто в песне, попутчик сказал, был поручиком. Носил и газыри, и усы, но по замашкам и по ранжиру числился в попечителях. Но не то что там ручек каких-нибудь станционных, нет, числился у себя в мандате попечитель-инспектором \nвсех чугунных путей. И наливает, вообразите, армянского. Да вы \nтрекнулись, три звездочки на беспаспортного переводить. Только \nпуговицами бликует. И поэтому, признается, мила мне планида железнодорожная, прикипел, грешным делом, люблю, извини, яичницу и промчаться в быстромелькающем скором. И куда же, ты думаешь, я направляюсь теперь? Не серчайте, я отвечал, я маршрутов \nваших не в курсе, билетов вам не покупаю пока, Илье билеты самому пока покупают. Думаешь, я у брата, что ли, в Казани вознамерился погостить? — поручик допытывался. Кто вас знает, я к брату \nбы и сам с пристрастием снегом на голову, там дури сколько влезет, \nешь-пей-ночуй, Мусю соседскую, если соскучился, можно на посиделки зазвать, с бредешком побродить можно бы. Бредешь так, знаете, по пояс в воде, а глина илистая — так и лезет пиявками между \nпальцами, аж завивается. Не говори, инспектор поддакивает, у самого, признаться, брат — пьяница. Что говорить, попечитель, брат — \nбрат и есть, только не шлет он в последние сроки приглашений мне \nникаких, и что у него там стряслось — не пойму: женился ли, болен, \nкандалами ли где звенит? Зря сомневаешься, отвечал, ясно, ими. Но, \nпо правде сказать, поручик, не припомню, чтоб он и прежде особенно часто строчил; нет, не часто он мне строчил, даже лучше выразиться — совсем никогда не писал. В кандалах не попишешь, поручик кивал, в Кандалакше-то. Да, и голову на плаху я вряд ли бы вам, \nпожалуй, свою положил за то, что имеется где бы то ни было этот \nбратец вообще; подозреваю, что и в заводе его у меня нет, как ни \nжаль, — ни в Казани с Рязанью, ни в Сызрани. А ну, говорит, разреши, я тебе за это плесну сызнова. И мы куликнули оба. А состав \nнаяривает себе ни в едином глазу, режет ночь молодую, как острый \nнорвежский нож, катит неблизко где-нибудь вязкой манульих глаз. \nВ околотке той же самой ночи́ дремлет, кемарит по-тихому, прикорнул швейной иглою в омете оперированный транзитный, вроде меня, и ему поезд чудится нездешнего назначения совершенно. Ахти \nмне, батенька, инспектор вздохнул, в Сызрани родственники не проживают сейчас, вот в Миллерове — пожалуйста, в Миллерове — полное ассорти, крестная сестрина там недавно как раз преставилась. \nИ представляется: Емельян Жижирэлла. Едрена палка, я выразился. И сразу обнял его, жирнягу, а он меня, худобу покорного. И высушили на брудершафт. Ну зачем же ты не писал-то мне, я укорял, \nхоть бы открытку бросил, одноутроб еще называется. Ты с налету \nне гневайся, он объяснял, недосуг в Кандалакше письма было писать, в каталажке-то, лучше скажи, отчего сам родню забываешь: \nя, например, на поминках в Миллерове не припомню тебя совсем, \nили известия не получил? Получить получил, с вручением. Сей же \nчас хватаю картуз, пролетку — и на вокзал. Подлетаю к солидному \nс саблей: где тут чего? Показывает. А у сабли внизу колесико, чтобы \nплавней волочить. Барышня, благоволите купейный до Миллерова. \nСабля подобная пули сильней, ибо свинец нет-нет да и сплющится, \nно от стали уж не отвертишься ни за что, от стали-то. На перроне — \nкультура: плевательницы, киоск. Восемнадцать минут. И нерешительность обуяла. Заявлюсь — пересудов не оберешься, вообразят, \nвероятно, невесть чего. Невдомек им, сквалыгам кровным, что не \nкаждый обязательно жлоб. Илье чужого не надо, у него и своего-то \nнет, но кому ты докажешь. Подавитесь поминками вашими, не поеду. Стою. Тут кондуктор трубит посадку, там проводник грубит, \nтам бабка мятлушкой забилась в стекло: Димка-внук у нее, извольте видеть, до дядьки в Углич отчаливает погостить. Гляди, сиротка, \nбез варежек в жару не гуляй. Сама ты, глиста худощавая, в оба поберегись, пыльцу бы тебе до срока не обтрясли. Что, папаша, к начальнику обращаюсь, отправку будем давать? А тебе почему интересно? — фуражку надвинул на лоб. Отвечаю, что особенно ни к чему, \nчто я про другое желал бы спросить, а отправка сама по себе не тревожит ни с какой стороны, что — отправка, подумаешь, отправляйте. \nПро что другое? — надменничает. Вы на рысистых испытаниях присутствовали хоть раз? Не то слово — присутствовал, околачивался \nя на них, большие средства на тотошке просаживал. Помните, значит, как ипподром-то горел, искры так и летели, не так ли? Как не \nпомнить, так и летели, даже заезд собирались сперва отменить. Собирались, только не выгорело это дело у них — понесли коники траверсом. Со старта, помнится, вырвался Поликлет, трехлетка каурый \nот Политехника с Клептоманией, но на второй кобылка Сметана \nпервой зашла, а Поликлетка на третье переложился, но вот кто ехал \nтогда на нем — уронила память петлю. Уронила так уронила, путеец \nсказал, но на этом про лошадей, пожалуйста, завершим, а то отправку, будучи из пожилых, срывать не к лицу вам. Задаетесь вы шибко, \nпапаша, нет бы чем в колокол колотить, пулечку со мной записать \nпо-быстрому. Тут сабля подкатывает: ну, что? Да что ж, пульку отъезжающий записать предлагает. Что же, это не заржавеет у нас, не \nколесико, лишь карты бы добыть некрапленые. Погодите вы с картами, он же просто отправку хочет сорвать. Помилуйте, дежурный \nвспылил, прямо шпионство какое-то. Не казните, не повторится, \nмне, понимаете, колокол ваш думы былые на ум привел, на бегах до \nпожара висел — ну вылитый. Брякнуло, звякнуло — поехало неудержимо. Крокодиловой кожи заслуженный чемодан в те хитрые годы, \nпусть сам я не верю теперь, я имел. Почему, впрочем, хитрые — годы \nкак годы, не хитрее других. Чемодан крокодиловой кожи, я повторяю, с замками, в те годы как годы, я, Дзындзырэлла, смею утверждать, имел. Я хватаю его — и дай бог ноги. Хлещет же — не передать. \nШли, как известно, и дождь, и поезд, один на Миллерово, вто рой \nвесь день. Милый брат, Емельян признается, как здорово шпарить \nнам к тебе в гости в Казань, ведь сколько не виделись. Погоди-ка, \nтревожусь, а почтограмму ты мне направил? Спрашиваешь, прямо \nс дороги. Да, бегу, стало быть, дебаркадером, догоняю вагон, а вскочить за отсутствием убеждений боязно. Полотеря в те годы как годы во всевозможных местах, я возил в чемодане мастику, тряпки, \nпотертый фетр и швабры поросячьих щетин. Проводник мой с флажками в чехлах зыком благим из тамбура заорал: отцепись, вдруг сорвешься в просак ты, как многие. Не глумись, кастелянша, над пассажирской бедой, чтоб тебе самому сорваться. А Емельяну я сказал, \nчто ау — не застигнет меня его отправление, и что зря, вероятно, \nспешит он в Казань — я не выбегу. Вам же, Сидор Фомич, пишу приблизительно следующее. Раз приходят некоторые к перевозчику, \nа тот спит беззаветно. Вот это, я понимаю — загадка, ибо это загадка, а не просто крестьянская быль. Не понимаю только, к которому \nперевозчику: два у нас перевозчика на Итиле́. Тот — на той стороне \nзашибает, этот — напротив — на этой. Первый — Ерема по прозвищу \nЖох, второй наоборот — Фома, и без всякого прозвища. Кличут человека уважительно, по фамилии, и нечего огород городить, правда же? Погибель — лодочника фамилья у нас. И положим, к нему \nи приходят: работа есть. Он проснулся — а что за труд? Зачем тщеславишься понапрасну, они говорят, будто перевоза помимо еще \nв некотором ремесле маракуешь. Учить себя никому не позволю, \nФома заявил, выкладывайте лучше факт. А попечитель разбушевался, ногами топает, словно я виноват; я и сам-то себя, сироту, в Казани никогда не встречал, если искренно. А куда же я шпарю тогда, \nинспектор кричит, отвечай. Попечитель, мудрящих я ваших маршрутов не в курсе, но если проездной документ у вас на руках, то не \nсочтите за дерзость в него заглянуть — там указано. Быть безысходно \nв просаках — Ильи Джынжирелы удел. Чтоб тебе самому сорваться, \nпроводник мой услышал мои слова. Так сказал ему сгоряча — а сам \nи сорвался. Что за комиссия, мол, приятель, оборвался, упал кулем \nпод колеса, и оттяпало бо́сую ноженьку, будто серпом. Вижу — ктото знакомый с клинком с поднебесных стропил слетает помочь. Серафим шестикрылый, дежурный, махни ятаганом раза́, отруби-ка \nвсего уж от настоящих мест: зельно болезен, неловкий. И начальник \nподоспел пожурить. Вам-то что, позавидовал, санаторию себе обеспечили, а людя́м выговорá по вашей линии получай. Не браните, \nмокропогодица ж, оскользаешься. Мысль: сорвалась, плакала, по-видимому, экспедиция, улыбнулось Илье последнее целование. И опять \nя в просаке, когда, гордясь, поручику советую в билет заглянуть. \nДуралей ты, он оборвал, попечитель билетов по званию брать не \nобязан, а когда и возьмет другой раз, то литерный и в любой конец, \nи гляди ты в этот билет, не гляди — все туман, и туда сего предъявитель отправился, сюда ли — ничего не понять, лишь плацкарта бьется купейная на ветру да талон на получение белья шелестит. Нет, не \nпыльно вы прилепились, земляк, но, видать, не всегда и везде попечителям выгода. Получается, непопечителям иногда очевиднее, куда им путь лег. Взять того же меня, мне — к Орине, ее мне вынь да \nположь, направление к ней мной держится.\n",

  content: "Note X\n\nOver the First Powdered Snow\n\n\n  The recipes of Bordeaux Gypsy women\n  Who are pressing deux côtes and châteaux\n  While the street-organs’ waltzes are streaming\n  The distilling plant does not know.\n  But inspectors know and adore—\n  For that reason, they never feel blue—\n  The sacred strength of Cahors,\n  With their thick maroon bottom goo.\n  Of this drink, first rejected, then stolen,\n  In embroidered bags of their own,\n  Many jugs and bottles they’re hauling\n  Right over the first powdered snow.\n  They bring many tasty provisions:\n  Canned goods and sausage, and cheese.\n  My inspectors, my rustlers, envision\n  That these endless feasts never cease!\n  But there brightly sparked as before—\n  ’Cause the utter darkness moved far—\n  In the whitened grave of the shores\n  Negru de Purcari red tar.\n  Though the curious hunter is saying:\n  Where do pheasants get fat around here?\n  Through the scraps of the dogs’ furious baying\n  Sesame!—that’s all we can hear.\n  Co-imbiber! The last gulp, my dear bloke,\n  Stash in your flabby cheek and hold there.\n  It’s time. Whir in barrels’ half chokes,\n  And in chokes, you whirlwind, whir-whir.\n\n\nNote XI\n\nCasting a Spell\n\n\n  May the Magpie be sick, may the Crow be sick too,\n  May the Dog be healthy and glad.\n  A cripple was walking around the world blue\n  \n    And his crutches were splattered with blood.\n  \n  His crutches walked over the snow’s bluish crust\n  And the clouds were revealing God’s face.\n  And while sand-covered Libya was choking in dust\n  \n    The Netherlands held the ice-skating race.\n  \n  The Wolf was taught by the mage hereabout,\n  So leaving his lair in the woods,\n  Just after the sunset, the Wolf would crawl out\n  \n    And heal the Dog as he could.\n  \n  May the Magpie be sick, may the Crow be sick too,\n  But thanks to Wolf’s love, in its name,\n  From the black river Crow to the river Nerl blue\n  \n    May the sick dogs be healthy and game.\n  \n  And in their shabby coats, in the blue world, outbound,\n  Not concerned if it is night or day,\n  Valiant hunters, making magpie-like chirping sounds,\n  \n    Chased the ermines from the copses away.\n  \n  Village folks, but alert and rarely forgive.\n  May Magpie the Thief still be sick.\n  They’ve spied out the place where this fellow lives\n  \n    And lifted, the rascals, his sticks.\n  \n  They drank them away and that would be all,\n  But when winter unleashed ice and snow,\n  Between self and Wolf, when sleep takes its toll,\n  \n    The Dog to the Wolf used to go.\n  \n  The Magpie is sick and the Crow is sick too,\n  The blizzard for the cloud ride can’t wait.\n  Village folks, mainly loners with nothing to do,\n  \n    Glide on skates with hands on their waists.\n  \n  And from the flat Brugge to the mountainous Liopp,\n  Or to Bydogoshchi from as far as Bobrov,\n  Factory hunters, loudly shouting, “Hey, hop!”\n  \n    Drink, enshaded by the snow-covered groves.\n  \n  At last, our cripple a new shotgun obtained\n  And found other crutches somehow.\n  Though his empty pant leg may still feel the pain\n  He’s a factory hunter right now.\n\n\nNote XII\n\nPhilosophical\n\n\n  Confusion—it’s an inevitable fault\n  Of clueless philosophers, passions, ages . . .\n  What kind of luck made me such a dolt\n  That I could not make sense of them all\n  \n    Or rather could, but less and less, in stages?\n  \n  When ways of knowledge came to be too dreary,\n  And city life, unsettling, hard to follow,\n  First, I became a hunter—ordinary,\n  But later turned into a binger—merry,\n  \n    With gaze both enlightened and quite hollow.\n  \n  I like all months, December up to March,\n  Plus April, May and June, July and August,\n  And Virgo always warms my lonely heart,\n  And Brumaires, whose rosy garb, so smart,\n  \n    Brings to my mind the famous bird named Argus.\n  \n  Now chilly winter in my garden stands\n  Like emptiness forgotten in a glass.\n  The glass, forgotten, on the table stands.\n  The table, forgotten, in the garden stands,\n  \n    Forgotten on the winter’s white tray-grass.\n  \n  Dear maestro, on the stovepipe wail\n  Something Christmasy—and make it andante.\n  Cold, with icicles on its lip, today,\n  Winter stands here, like a thing per se,\n  Noticing, really, neither Kant nor canto.\n\n\nNote XIII\n\nValday Dream\n\n\n  Just before the stars unfold\n  From the smoke I’m crying.\n  The wolf’s tail—be cold, be cold,\n  The dog’s—warmed by fire.\n  By the hearth, deep in his lair,\n  Cat snores, as he dozes.\n  And his boot, in disrepair,\n  Sticking nail exposes.\n  And he dreams, this Valday Cat,\n  Purring-Puss, while snoozing:\n  On the bridge sit wolves all set,\n  Therefore, he is musing:\n  If I were a dog, I’d love\n  The Wolf who’s so lonely,\n  And if I were a wolf I’d howl\n  After the Dog only.\n  From a window I’ll look out\n  Or glance from another—\n  A snow-dusted pine stands proud\n  In the glade snow-smothered.\n  Witches chat of times of old\n  By the graveyard’s pyre.\n  Holy tail—be cold, be cold,\n  Devil’s—warmed by fire.\n  And completely bluish-gray\n  Is mica-covered Volga.\n  The Dog’s riding in a sleigh,\n  Prodding the Wolf onward.\n\n\nNote XIV\n\nFishing Under Ice\n\n\n  Neither the sturgeon fish live in this river\n  Nor the Chauliodus fish in a shoal.\n  So why do I, like an anglerfish, shiver,\n  \n    With my mouth open by the ice hole?\n  \n  Fellow, limp home and better be gone!\n  The time for playing has passed.\n  And the curtain of tattered dawn\n  \n    Onto Europe concealed wasisdas.\n  \n  Listen, you Binger, scram or you’ll lose!—\n  I held myself in a firm rein.\n  Better swallow some rotgut, infused\n  \n    Half and half with the tears of grain.\n  \n  Whom is God guiding down over here,\n  With a lamp, on ice skates, half bent?\n  Well, Aladdin Bartrutdinov is near,\n  \n    By Allah the Tatar is sent.\n  \n  Eh you, humpback, you are no angel,\n  Go to hell, you blasted slime!\n  What’s your lamp for, you alien stranger,\n  \n    During this somnolent time?\n  \n  Yakshi, you fish bait, did you catch your fill?\n  Hunchbacked pony, skedaddle, rock!\n  You are a disease, you make the soul ill,\n  \n    Bartrutdinov’s been a hundred years yok.\n  \n  He fell through the ice while skating at dusk,\n  And only surfaced after a year.\n  In his pocket dominoes as well as a flask,\n  \n    And chewed off by fish lips and ears.\n  \n  I forgot the date he came back afloat.\n  Pyotr and Pavel found him at large.\n  They finished the flask, then played whack the goat,\n  \n    And informed the folks in charge.\n  \n  He took off. Ah, what a deceiver.\n  And he used to be a loner first class.\n  Neither the chimaera fish live in this river,\n  Nor the fish, for instance, hump bass.\n\n\nNote XV\n\nArchival\n\n\n  Oh, I will feel so stuffy\n  Filling the dusty shelves\n  Of the archival stacks.\n  Eh, I’ll be bored to death.\n  One day and out of breath\n  An archivist will come.\n  He’ll start to excavate me,\n  My doodles he’ll decipher,\n  And dig up in old files\n  A ticket to Kunstkammer,\n  A petal from some summer,\n  And ’mid the other notes,\n  This one he’ll find, indeed,\n  And ’bout himself he’ll read.\n  Ha ha, he’ll laugh, ha ha,\n  All through the archive. Rude,\n  Unpleasant, and irate,\n  A hunter out of date\n  And yet astute and shrewd.\n  And how excited he’ll be\n  With what he had found out.\n  And he will be, just be,\n  While I’ll be gone, away,\n  Each week and every day.\n  But how eternal I’ll be—\n  No present and no past,\n  Away from taking chances,\n  In crowded circumstances,\n  And suffocating dust.\n\n\nNote XVI\n\nA Verse About a Beautiful Lonesome Babe\n\n\n  Over the coffeepot the steam waves\n  Like a capitulation flag from a trench.\n  Brew me some coffee, my lovely wench,\n  \n    Because this draft is worthy of raves.\n  \n  Keep waving, broadcast the news from Brazil,\n  This aroma is praised all around,\n  With chicory it can always be found,\n  \n    Even when from Brazil there is nil.\n  \n  By fate we’re so often rebuked\n  That chicory we love like the Erzia,\n  But aren’t we somebody’s ersatz\n  \n    And isn’t our goose fully cooked?\n  \n  For that reason, though I know in my soul\n  That all beauties are easy to flatter,\n  I declare that it does not matter\n  \n    Who is mending my coat and my shawl.\n  \n  Notwithstanding that no one can sew\n  Out of sweet talk fur coats, I’ll opine:\n  Oh, my lonesome babe, you’re so fine,\n  \n    And your mug’s not to drink from, you know.\n  \n  So I sharpen my penknife, I do:\n  Since the day of your angel is near,\n  Having nothing to give you, my dear,\n  \n    A boar’s hide I will scrape just for you.\n  \n  Brew me now, at the threshold of dusk,\n  In midevening, at pre-winter’s boding,\n  Pseudo-coffee that a quasimodic\n  False matchmaker had kindly loaned us.\n\n\nNote XVII\n\nTo the Unknown Painter\n\n\n  Buddy! Like a Serb can’t make\n  A Croatian chisma fit,\n  And our own memorial wake\n  Or the cabbage soup’s high price\n  Often bore us quite a bit,\n  The same way this harsh advice\n  Painters like you really need.\n  Either you mixed up the features\n  And impressions of the past\n  Or the Gorodnishche’s picture\n  Without glasses you recast.\n  Hence the hunters you arranged\n  In old-fashioned cowls and clothes\n  Seem to me no less than strange,\n  Even more, in panty hose.\n  And the deal would not have ended\n  With success, as we would like,\n  If the hunt we had attended\n  Not with guns but with a pike.\n  On which, well seen from this angle,\n  Right behind the hunter’s back,\n  Hangs the image of a tangled\n  Wolf-dog, waving like a flag.\n  On the things’ established order\n  You applied a fancy veil:\n  Hunting bags with gold embroidered\n  Are at odds with our trails.\n  And from crashbaret three lookers\n  Seem too pretty and too neat,\n  When, unhurried, they are cooking\n  A plump piglet on the spit.\n  And this dolce vita, master,\n  Shaded by the roofs askew,\n  Which you tried so hard to muster\n  With your brush, palette, and luster,\n  It is gone, wrapped in weeds’ cluster.\n  But crows are the same—so shoo!\n  Nonetheless—what a great picture,\n  Look around you once or twice,\n  And admire those bewitching\n  Brews of sky, and snow, and ice.\n  In the time of twilight pealing,\n  The ice skaters’ puppy squealing\n  Can be heard from far beyond—\n  On the river and the ponds.\n  If I were a merchant mogul\n  Your oil painting I would buy,\n  Hang it o’er my cot to ogle,\n  And, forgetting all, I’d lie.\n  But because I am a tippler,\n  I will buy me some green wine\n  And I’ll see the same, but triple\n  When the drink starts working fine.\n  Here’s my fatherland: Though glorious,\n  It cares not for poor folks’ strife,\n  But how lovely’s the notorious\n  Vanity of our life.\n\n\nNote XVIII\n\nTransfiguration of Nikolay Helperov\n\n(A Junkman’s Story)\n\n\n  There’s a reason for the vagrants to attest:\n  Sweet agarics on the Volga are the best.\n  But some people just surprise us, when they muse:\n  Vodka is the worst of poisons, of no use.\n  By this judgment, pardon us, we’re not impressed,\n  We, the junk folk, life without it cannot see.\n  True, sometimes we imbibamus in excess,\n  But in turn how much transfigured we may be.\n  Once from house to house we wandered-tramped,\n  Asking people: Help your guests, for goodness sake,\n  Bring outside your garbage pile, clean your dump:\n  Metal, glass, and even bones we gladly take.\n  Dusk has fallen. And of course—a snowing fest.\n  Freaking bitch, don’t you growl and don’t you bark!\n  We set out to see the tailor, get some rest,\n  Helper Kolya schlepped with us, and it was dark.\n  Kolya Helperov, I meant to say, who was old,\n  Broken up, a guy with badly twisted legs.\n  We are pilgrims—he’s one far above us all,\n  We are cripples—he’s one far above the rest.\n  Our Kolya-Nikolay owns simply nil,\n  Only crutches. And it snows, it really snows.\n  Weather sucks. The bells clamor on the hill,\n  And to find a place for slumber fly the daws.\n  They fly straight across the river, scalawags,\n  To the town of thieves and beggars for a nap.\n  While we’re lugging on a hand sleigh garbage bags—\n  Three archangels of recycling the old scrap.\n  Ah, the time of dog and wolf I love so much:\n  It’s like kindness mixed with sadness, isn’t it?\n  I will also have a smoke; hold the match!\n  So, we’re schlepping to the tailor, I repeat.\n  Sewing clothing for the shelter of the blind,\n  Our tailor’s sitting there by candlelight.\n  Open up, dear fellow creature, be so kind,\n  Welcome us—exhausted merchants—for the night.\n  We were sitting by the window, feeling fine,\n  Night was turning gray like pants too often washed.\n  I forget now, where we finally got the wine,\n  But remember—we got very soundly sloshed.\n  In the morning, we see: Kolya learned to fly!\n  Crutches—like a pair of wings he bore.\n  He had turned into a falcon, poor old guy.\n  Drank too much. And he simply was no more.\n\n",

  content: "I have scooped up, keep on readin, the hooch of human \npassions, tasted the rot of dreadful, deceitful broads, and \nthe poison almost choked me. The dusk lasted and the \ndarkness continued, and at dawn opened, like a wound, the unquenchable drought for the clean, for the crystal-clear water. I \nused whatever I had for a belt and stepped, figurelatively \nspeakin, into the deep, squirmin. What is happiness and what \nis unhappiness, my dear Pozhilykh? Don’t pass, the answer \nain’t complicated: Happiness is when it is. But I don’t complain; everythin will get milled over. We’ll finish clinkin with \nour unsharpened skates, hurtin from oaken clubs, frolickin and \ndancin, and one day in the mornin we’ll cast off to Bydogozhd. \nSo many toasts will be drunk in our honor, so many tears will \nbe spilled, so many collars will be ripped by our pals from each \nother’s coats on the ninth day. Earlier, we were seein others off, \nsailin noisily in sloops, and now others will revel followin us in \ndories, while we will peacefully lie in the front one with our \nsole akimbo. Foma Doom himself on the occasion of such an \nevent rekindled his past—grabbed the oars. He is rowin, for \nsure, but at the same time on the sly searches with his bare foot \nthe pockets of my gala apparel. You’re tryin in vain, my dear, \nthey cleaned up all the creases before you, not even one \nbit of tobacco is left. No, don’t take me wrong, I’m not \ncomplainin—there will be flour. I wandered a lot, worked and \nexosted myself, yet even more I twiddled my thumbs. I toughened and matured, got smooth and burnished, like a well-worn \nyoke. I turned into last year’s old loaf, a callus and gristle, and \nwasn’t I a fancy bun just last evenin? I’ll turn around, fold my \nearflaps up, and look at myself hurryin in burlap along the \nspeckled way—there I feel high, close to the Lordie, there I feel \nglorious. I’ll feast my eyes. Who am I, they ask sometimes, and \nfor whom? I’m a matchmaker and brother for someone, for \nsomeone a godfather, and occasionally a son-in-law, I guess, no \nmore, no less. But sometimes—I am nobody for nobody, only \nfor myself, and even then not entirely. Now a slicker and roisterer, I tumble into the burdock—tomorrow a marsh hawk, \nI’m hootin like an owl in the pine grove. But when I sleep myself sober I’m a prophet again. That’s nothin, really, compared \nto the moment when once in a blue moon, I walk along the \nspeckled path to do my sharpenin: I turned into a Sharpener, a \ncraftsman of the unfamiliar suns. There, on the right side, burn \nthe Fiery Stozhary—here, on the left, rises Krylobyl, the clubfooted hunter. Behind me are the Nurses, in front—Orina-Foolina and her progeny Orion. I wandered a lot around the \nworld’s fringes and defined many constellations. There is a constellation of Lonesome Babe, only I cannot figure out which \none; there are Lieutenants, Buoy Keepers, and Inspectors. There \nis a Bingin Hunter, a lively carouser in this world, a fine fellow—\nnotorious  for  his  unquenchable  thirst  and  extraordinary \nboldness as far as and includin the Kimry model sluices. He’s \nwritin somethin, flippin the pages: Will You allow me to cite a \nfew thoughts? Ain’t it wrong, he claims, to pour this year’s wine \ninto an old barrel? It will tear apart all its seams, it will warp \nthe thing, and, what’s even worse, it will spill out. Good, \ngood advice, nothin to argue about. The only thing—it doesn’t \nconcern us, he’s not talkin about our destitute Beyond the \nWolf, since how could we get hold of so much wine to fill at \nonce the entire barrel—makes no difference whether new or \nsecondhand—for what kind, allow me to express my doubts, \nof You know what? Much more useful is the other lesson there. \nIt’s senseless, he teaches, to place new patches on the ripped \njunk—unsightly. And in addition, why would You tear apart \nwhat is whole? Well, this—this is about us, this we understand. \nBut, honestly, even that really is of no use; after all, is there anythin new among these tatters of ours? And there was one more \nincident.  A  sower  was,  supposedly,  sowin.  It’s  not  clear \nwhere—on the Fallows, on Lazarus Field, or by Granny’s \nCross. And this also happened: One beggar woman met the \nWintry Man in the woods and from fright Kondraty caught \nher. Gradually, they found her. The raven pecked her eyes out, \nworms ate the mushrooms in her basket, and the pines stand \naround as they stood before, until they’ll burn. So they placed \non that clearin a memorial cross. And the sower threw one \ngrain next to the road, dropped the second on rocky ground, \nthe third into the thorns, and only the fourth he managed to \nplant more or less successfully. All told, a gyrfalcon grasped \none grain, a kite the second, and a quail the third. And what did \nYou think? Whether they want to or not, they need to take care \nof nourishment. However, the fourth grain managed to make it \nand produced, out of the blue, an immeasurable crop—a hundred grains. I read for a while the hunter’s book and realized: \nEverythin will get milled over. Don’t worry, the constellation \nPozhilykh can be seen among us too. Lookin from below, You \nare positioned two elbows above the Wintry Man’s star. You \nresemble a handful of fireflies. And he glows in the darkness \nlike a large shiner, even though, upon verification, he’s a squirt. \nThe given warden as a person is of ordinary age, but as himself, \nhe’s visible, noticeable. Smallpox slightly changed his portrait, \nthen—the hunt marked him with shot, the frost and wine \nburned his nose, and a rabid fox bit off his ear: We can understand that granny. I see—now the Wintry Man is drivin his \nspouse to perish; he could not take it anymore. My Sharpenhauers with Gury the gameslayer on the outskirts started \nsmokin, they’re talkin, and Ilya Dzynzyrella in a far-off work \nlocation told the elder sister: I desire your mussels, gimme as \nmany as you can, salt and matches are present. Dusk’s everywhere; evenin’s everywhere; Itil’s all over. But there, where the \nWintry Man is squeakin with his carriage—fall descended \nfrom heavens, at my colleagues’ place, in Gorodnishche—a \nsnowstorm began, and on my Wolf River—orioles and woodpeckers. I do what the elder sister orders and step up to my \nknees into the wave. I stuff my shoulder bag to the gills and set \na small fire. I can hear—the masters are buzzin in December at \nthe foot of the hill. They are talkin mainly about Pyotr; the \ngrinders ain’t sure what’s goin on with him. He, Yegor, returned \nthen to the sitters on the spit and told them that after that dame \nthere is nothin to break the clouds in his existens; he may as \nwell hang himself. They started cheerin him up: You’ll always \nhave time to hang yourself, better let’s chat. Well, if you wanna \nchat, let’s chat, Pyotr, adamant, agreed right away. Do you \nknow the village Overbrowears? Yes, I do, a sawmill is workin \nthere, supposedly. Right, so let’s wager a bet that you won’t lift \nfrom there even one baluster, and even if you lift it, you’ll be \ntoo sissy to choke on it, you won’t have the guts, it’s doubtful, \nlet’s say, you won’t gag on it, you’ll pass, you’ll chicken out, etc. \nThat’s what the sitters told Pyotr on the spit, that’s what they, \nthe sitters, kept sayin to Fyodor, and Ilya is gettin ready for supper, he’s fryin the mussels on the coals. The breeze has calmed \ndown, the ripples on the water and on my soul have settled \ncompletely, and the nightingale in adder’s tongue is spinnin \ncock-and-bull stories. Well, they’re talkin about the sawmill \nand I about the factory. I heard a voice: Keep in mind that in \nthe comin future they will establish a factory at the mouth of \nthe stream Slush, and not of any kind, just so, but to make buttons. When they establish it, when it gets goin, and when it \nbegins makin buttons, everybody will start walkin buttoned to \nthe hilt. And they will need mother-of-pearl aplenty—just \nkeep draggin it in. So they will open next to the factory a point, \nnot of honin skates to a point but a collection point, and they’ll \nstart collectin mussels from the populace of the entire land ’cuz \nquite a lot of mother-of-pearl is hidin in them. And to the one \nwho deposits more useful stuff than the others, the factory will \npresent a dory. I’m tellin You as it is, I heard the voice: Don’t be \nlazy, collect the treasures. I wandered a lot and ate many suppers, and how many mussels I laid bare, no one can count. I hid \na mass of the empty folds, cleverly fashioned in the manner of \nbeggars’ palms, the priceless folds, dull at the bottom. I was \nhidin them openly, spreadin them on the ground ’cuz the thing \nlyin in plain sight is lyin there hidden better than anythin. \nTherefore, You, after learnin the secret, stay away, don’t You \ndebit my pearls, else You shall find You know what. Well, if You \nwanna turn them around in Your hands, go on, turn, I will not \nforbid You, but after You’ve turned them, put them back where \nYou found them, otherwise it’ll end up that Carl stole from \nClara a coral tiara. I request this to be announced like an order, \nso they comply; after all, they’re all chimney pots first-class. \nAnd they got into a habit of convertin them all into ashtrays. \nEnough, a certain day, You know, will come. The moment I notice that the barges with woodcutters float by to saw timber, I \ngrab a sack as capacious and as intact as possible and scurry at \na brisk clip around the beevaks of the bygone feasts. I collect \nthem, deliver to the address, and the boat is mine. Not too \nshabby a dory, everybody will comment, Ilya had procured for \nhimself, not just so-so. And what did You think, I will say, You \nassumed that I am a blockhead, a numskull? You hoped that \nthe grinder has mush in his stockpot? No, enviers, no, freeloaders, I only look like a dude without all his marbles, only pretend to snuggle with manure. A bright future will begin for me \nwith my personal dinghy. That’s when we, passionate mushroom pickers, will get into a habit of goin after forest berries \nthere, Beyond the Wolf. And even though I am invitin You cordially, there’s tension about transportation. Nevertheless, I believe, someday we will get even to the other side; let’s just work \nout a short delay. I repeat, get Yourself—hook or crook—some \ngummies, ’cuz to have the ankels stung by the nettles in the \nhollows is just a nuisance, but there are also vipers hidin in gullies. Yes, and grab a raincoat in case of unexpected rain. Be well, \nmy gangly friend in a mackintosh and a cap, climb in, the stern \nhas been longin after You. I already spread there some mint, \nlungwort, and hemlock so it would smell nice, to get rid of the \nunwanted odor. And we finally cast off, banterin. And more \nprecisely, at the last moment You started whinin, refused to \ngo—and I set out alone. I set out to gallivant in my first-rate \nhazel groves, bequeeted to me one fall by a certain old-timer. \nHe bequeeted them, showed me, and before spring chose to \njoin the dead. But the hazel groves are really tiptop, in each \ncluster there are more nuts than a homeless goat has, not to \noffend her, dingleberries under her tail. True, to my shame, afterward I had not visited this real estate of mine even once. \nWhat a tale, why would I not go there anymore in the co-op’s \ndory? ’Cuz we had drunk the co-op’s vessel away usin the coop’s method about twenty-five times. It’s as simple as steamin \nturnips, but it allows us to launch all kinds of provisions or \nfoodstuffs more than once. Every now and then, there is no \nmoney: No problem, it’s their business, but there is a cat. Obviously, not ours, the grinders’; we don’t need it; so far, mice \ndon’t munch on iron; the miller, You see, has a cat. And one of \nour loafers pretends to be a wandrin cripple and goes to the \nmiller on the hill: What village do You have here? Don’t take it \namiss, he says, it’s Malokulebyakovo. And I thought that it \nwould be Mylomukomolovo. No, Mykomulolomovo is an old \nsong, we were called Mykomulolomovo long ago. Hmm, and \nwhere is Milokurelemovo in this case? Malokulelemovo, quoth \nhe, is in a completely different location, mallow we never\nkulelemed. And while they talk all this nonsense, our slickers \nwith a sack keep their watch for the cat behind the barn. The \nmiller calls on a foggy dawn his Siberian angora, wanders, thunderous, along the Itil, but the cat’s far away. Get it together, \ndunderhead, the culprits will release it into good hands. And \nright away a new shift rolls up its sleeves. I believe the co-workers \nwon’t lemme down and will remove the mouser from the buyer \nin the same way. A similar brouhaha could be observed with \nthe dory. I can’t say now from whom we had pilfered it first, the \nevent is too distant, and it’s not really important. I’ll only note \nthat later we floated it many times and regularly and also always without fail to those who understood the deal. At the \nend, however, we  failed, brought shame on  ourselves; we \npassed it to one quite irresponsible. Havin finished the transaction, after the sunset, we appear like thieves under the cover of \nthe night around the riverside dock, where, accordin to the \nforcast information, that fellow was plannin to keep our scow. \nWe look—there’s no flat-bottom boat, only a pile of splinters \nlies nearby. It becomes clear: Right when we were bargainin \nwith the poor wretch, someone cleaned up his bathhouse. \nThey took the basket, the scrubber, a sliver of soap, and the \nbeaker. And in addition they pulled out the net from the stream \n’cuz that bathhouse was near the stream. The wardens did it, no \ndoubt about it. And when the buyer arrived home in his new \npurchase and discovered the loss, he started shakin all over. \nWhy are you laughin?—asked some Cheremis folks that sat \nnot far from there, beltin the grape—What’s so funny? How \ncan I not laugh, answered this Vasya—’cuz it was he. How can \nI not laugh, he answered; I saw among the damages of fate the \nsingle singular ray of light—the trap net full of holes—and I \ndreamed of becomin a fisherman, I wanted to buy a dory. And \nobserve: Either the dory is uke and the net e-e, or the dory e-e \nand the net uke, got stolen. No, Micheas the Morasthite taught \nwrong that everyone setteth a net for his brother; here we have \na different picture: You, brother, set a net and your bro absconds with it. And so Vasily findeth an ax and heweth our craft \ndue to its uselessness, rejoicin in his heart. And this way we \nbecame boatless in our nunset years, we utterly lost our craft \nusin our co-op’s method. So how can I, he says, not be laughin?\n\nAnd yet, Fomich, let’s assume that You and I managed to get \na rowboat. We prepared, got hold of the gummies, the basket, \nand the raincoat, and what is typical—I set off and You abstained. I started worryin: Did You catch the flu, are You sick? \nNo, the health fits the norm, simply some work-related problems \nshowed up—I’m in a hurry to get familiar with Your letter, so \nmy mushrooms, unfortunately, will have to wait. Truth’s on Your \nside, a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush, get familiar, \ngenerously raise my hopes. I pushed off with the usual—and like \na harmless water strider started measurin the wide-open space \nwith my jerks. The rowlocks are cryin exactly like lapwings, \nthey’re not oiled at all. Did You notice what weather we’re havin? \nPure delight, superior to the previous. It would be great to grab \nfrom You on this occasion a couple of smokes, and put the first \nbetween my teeth, the second behind my ear for later. Impossible beauty. The old pine forest is red; the woods are like a fox \nwith burn marks; the Itil flows like a pearly honey, you can eat \nit with a spoon. And the water is translucent, like in the moonlight, and millions-gazillions of empties lie on the bottom, and \nyou can read with ease any label stuck on them, as if thru the \ncounter’s glass. I could dive, gather the disowned vessels—and \nright away to Sloboda. Eh? Calm down, these are all silly dreams, \nit’s enormously deep, and, in general, we’re not divers. In contrast, for leeches it’s accessible—they keep suckin. And where \nare the crucians, that is, the ruffs? I looked carefully—they \nwere snoozin in the holes, in the shadow of the banks, under \nthe tree roots, and Orina was swimmin above me, spreadin her \nthighs completely like a frog. She was swimmin on the surface \nlike in a mirror, as if temptin, and her long hair was draggin like \nalgae along her sides and spine, and her breasts—to be honest—\nwere movin like a pair of large tenches among other fishes. From \nmy distant nearby I could without any pangs of conscience get \nimpressions from the woman, and I was inspectin her all, as long \nas I had enough air, and when I did not, I would come up, take a \nfew breaths, and back. With her saucy figure she was teasin geese \nin Ilya on purpose, but I held my temper in check, not givin amnesty to my nerves, and proudly kept my patience—keep teasin, \nkeep teasin, we, the orphans, don’t need to get used to it, we can \nbear it. But keep in mind: When my cravins get too strong due \nto long prayers, I will force you, snub nose, in every possible way \nand then, a kinless worm, I will shamelessly warm up the stick of \nmy flesh, I will ride you good and proper. And as for the mussels, \nthey were also there, scattered all over. Some were just lyin simply \nscattered, reflectin the light, and the others were creepin along accurately, who knows where, and were leavin on the pliable, loose \nground such tracks as if the crawlin Gorynych had made them, \nvery thin. Matches and salt, You are hintin, did I have with me? \nNot entirely: Among the other special items, they were located \nin my clothes, and they, in turn, in scabiosas, in thick bushes. Before my maimin, and even later—up to that lonesome babe that \nstitched all my cylinders dead shot, so I wouldn’t aimlessly poke \nwith my hands in my pockets—preservin the customs of my \nancestors, I kept all my possessions there. Nowadays, I pack my \nstuff partially in my bag and partially into an empty tied-up pant \nleg—comfort. They say that unhappiness leads to happiness, but \nmine surely didn’t. That’s it. What I had predicted for Orina in \nmy mind, did happen. I visit her on the same date in July, You \nunderstand, on the twentieth accordin to the Old Style, it’s Ilya’s \nname day and her day off for overtime. No sense to sit inside—\nlet’s go and have some fun. Time—close to five. Its weak, gentle \nair was gettin cooler, but the frogs, what the heck, started croakin \nlike insane, they sensed my mood. I had with me fourteen rubles \nin change; I collected them at the station in the mornin. Out of \nthat, just under the platform I found about a ruble—our passenger is still a loser. And all in all, it’s wonderful under the platform, cozy—you smoke, cough, and nobody gives a spit where \nyou are and, perhaps, who. In contrast, thru the cracks between \nthe boards you can be curious and observe everythin perfectly: \nFor instance, some ladies for some reason don’t wear undies at \nall. Well, so Orina took an advance a day earlier—have yourself a blast. There was, existed, in those tricky years like years, \na joint—not a joint, a shop—not a shop, and properly speakin, \na snack bar. It was located a stone’s throw from the barracks, \nmore than close; it was gapin with its window frames at the road. \nWe got supplies and found a quiet spot behind the dike, among \nthe acacias, in the midst of lady’s smocks. For Orya, accordin to \nnot our custom, I spread down my jacket, and myself—simply \nlike that. We had a bite: dried Azov sea roach, third quality—\neven now it stands in front of my eyes. We sang, chanted, and \nthen I quoted her from memory a few racy adventures. And \nit was gettin overcast, the storm was approachin from the reservoir, and I started regrettin my ploy, ’cuz the croakers made \nus sick and tired—completely sick and tired with their loud \nchorus. I considered turnin the clouds back, but laziness overwhelmed me, I got sauced up and feeble. God be with it, I am \nthinkin, let the hidden water in the clouds thunder, perhaps it’ll \npass by. But no, it started pourin. It caught us on the meadow, \nby the swings. Everythin turned gloomy, started shakin, drippin. Let’s run, she hurries. And drags me to the shore. An overturned abandoned scow was lyin there on the pebbles upside \ndown and a short slingshot supported its rim, makin it possible \nto get under. The matches got wet, but a flint stone and steel \ndid not refuse—I set the punk on fire in a flash. Dry crumbly \nsplinters and used mouthpieces from papirosy, and all kinds \nof flammable trifles I found in excess, so the fire started right \naway. The light wonderfully illuminated Orina, and it also lit \nIlya up, and our shadows started crawlin along the coarse boat \nsides. Bugbear’s walkin, full of life, carries seven slippers: for \nhimself, for his wife, and a slipper for each nipper, I remember \ntellin her. The gusher scratches and scrapes the planks, but we \nare dry, we are talkin and restin on the old junk. You revealed \nto me your life stories, my friend says to me, so if you want— \nI will also tell you a few things.\n",

  content: "Зачерпнул я, читайте, сивухи страстей человеческих, отведал \nгнилья злообразных обманчивых жен, и отрава едва не придушила \nменя. Сумерк длился, и морок был, а на рассвете открылась, как рана, неутишимая алчба по чистому, по незамутненной воде. Препоясался я чем попадя и пошел, выражаясь условно, на самую глубь, \nюля. Что есть счастье и что есть несчастие, милый Вы мой? Не пасуйте, ответ незатейлив: счастие — это когда оно есть. Но не сетую, \nперемелется. Отзвеним неточеными, отболим кумполами дубовыми, отдурим и отпляшем, и отчалим однажды по утрию в Быгодождь. То-то пито будет во имя нас, то-то слез лито, то-то воротов \nпонарвут друг другу приятели на девятый день. Прежде мы провожали, плывя в челноках шумно, а теперь другим пировать следом \nв стругах, нам же тихо лежать на переднем подошвой врозь. Сам \nПогибель Фома ради такого случая стариною тряхнул — за весла \nсел. Он грести-то гребет, но и карманы нашего парадного обмундёра \nобшаривает втихаря босиком. Зря стараешься, дорогой, до тебя все \nпрорухи обчистили, ни махорины нет. Что Вы, что Вы, не сетую — \nстанет мука́. Много бродил я, трудился и выбивался из жил, обаче \nболее бил баклухи. Взматерел я и выстарел, залоснился и вытерся, \nкак в обиходе хомут. Тертый калач прошлогодний я сделался, мозоль и хрящ, а не вечор ли был сдобою. Обернусь, заломя треух, \nоглянусь на себя, поспешающего в рогожке пестрядинным путем, — \nвысоко мне там, близко к Боженьке, там славно мне. Залюбуюсь. \nКто я, спрашивается иногда, и кому. Брат и сват я кому-то, кому-то \nкум, а бывает, что вовсе зять — ни дать и ни взять. Но бывает — \nникто никому, сам себе лишь, и то не весь. Ныне — пройда и бражник, валюсь в лопух, завтра — лунь я болотный, кычу совой в бору. \nА просплюсь — и пророк опять. Это что еще, вот когда-никогда путем пестрядинным точить иду: стал Точильщик, кустарь посторонних солнц. Там, по правую руку, Стожары-пожары горят, тут, по \nлевую, — Крылобыл, косолапый стрелок, восходит. Позади у меня \nМедицинские Сестры, впереди — Орина-дурина и чадо ее Орион. \nМного бродил я по мироколице и много созвездий определил. Есть \nсозвездье Бобылки, только не разбираю какой, есть Поручики, Бакенщики, Инспектора. Есть Запойный Охотник, заводной в миру \nбузотер, мужик правильный — жаждой неугасимой, удалью исключительной до кимрских образцовых слюз включительно пресловут. \nПишет нечто, листает — позвольте ряд мыслей выдержать? Не превратно ль, доказывает, вино сего года в старую бочку лить, разорвет \nоно ее по всем швам, искорёжит вещь и, что обиднее, само вытечет. \nДобрый, добрый совет, возразить нечего. Единственно — не про нас, \nне про нашу Заитильщину небогатую он, ибо как бы это нам винища столь себе раздобыть, чтобы всю бочку — без разницы, новую \nтам или б/у — затарить враз, на какие, с разрешения усомниться, \nтаковские. Куда полезнее иной там урок. Нечего, учит, приставлять \nцелые заплаты к тряпью рваному — неказисто. А потом — целоето к чему раздирать. Вот это — про нас, это мы понимаем. Но признаться, и оно ни к чему как-то фактически, ведь имеем ли новое \nчто-нибудь среди хламоты нашенской. И еще один случай произошел. Сеял якобы сеятель. Неясно где — на Рунихах, на Лазаревом \nли Поле, у Бабкина ли Креста. Тоже было: сошлась одна богаделка \nс Зимарь-Человеком в лесах — и Кондратий ее с испугу хватил. Постепенно находят. Очи у нее ворон выклевал, грибки в туеске червячок поел, а бор как стоял — так и стоит вокруг, пока не сгорит. \nИ вкопали на той поляне на память крест. Сеятель же одно зерно \nпри дороге бросил, другое на камни какие-то уронил, третье в чертополох, и лишь четвертое более или менее удачно поместить ему \nудалось. Итого, одно зерно кречет усвоил, второе — коршун, иное — \nперепела. А вы́ как думали? Им продовольствоваться хочешь не \nхочешь, а тоже крутись. Зато четвертое взошло с грехом пополам \nи выдало ни с того ни с сего урожай непомерный — сто зерен. Почитал я ту книгу охотникову и осознал: перемелется. Не волнуйтесь, наблюдается посреди нас и созвездие Пожилых. Если снизу \nсмотреть, два локтя Вы повыше располагаетесь Зимарь-Человека \nзвезды. Словно пригоршня светляков Вы. Тот же светит, как крупный фингал впотьмах, хоть на поверку и мухортный. Егерь данный \nкак личность в обычных летах, но сам собою видный, заметный. \nОспа портрет ему слегка изменила, еще — дробью охота его потратила, нос — морозом, вином нажгла, а лис ему бешеный ухо отгрыз: \nпонимаем ту бабушку. Вижу — Зимарь супругу теперь губить повез, \nне вытерпел, Даниилы мои с Гурием-звероловом под городом воскурили, беседуют, а Илья Дзынзырэлла в отхожей местности старшой объявил: жадаю ракушек твоих, мне их побольше давай, соль \nи спички имеются. Всюду сумерки, всюду вечер, везде Итиль. Но \nтам, где Зимарь-Человек телегой скрипит — заосеняло с небес, у коллег в Городнище завьюжило, а на моей Волка-речке — иволга да \nжелна. Поступаю, как старшая велит, и вступаю по колено в волну. \nНабиваю суму переметную я битком и развожу костерок. Слышу — \nмастера в декабре под горой гудят. Речь у них главным образом \nпро Петра, недостаточно ясно точильщикам, что с ним такое. Возвратился тогда Егор к сидням на́ косу и сказал им, что нету ему после той дамы развеянья от бытия ни в чем, хоть вешайся. Те утешать: повеситься ты всегда успеешь, спорить лучше давай. Спорить \nтак спорить, Петр, заядлый, согласился тотчас. Знаешь ли селение \nВышелбауши? Знаю, завод лесопильный там как бы работает. Верно, давай мы, значит, спорить пари, что не спроворить тебе оттуда \nхотя бы одну балясину, а когда и спроворить, то слабо́ тебе на ней \nудавиться, слабо, вряд ли, пожалуй, удушишься ты на ней, запасуешь, кишка тонка и так далее. Это сидни Петру на косе говорили, \nэто они, сидни, твердили Федору, а у Ильи дело к ужину, ракушки \nна угольях пеку. Скис ветерок, и рябь на воде ли, в душе ли на место \nвся улеглась, и соловей тут в ужовниках пули льет. Кто про завод — \nя про фабричку. Голос был мне: имей в виду, учредят в грядущие \nсроки фабричку при устье Жижи-ручья, не какую-авось, так себе, \nа пуговичную. Как учредят, как запустят да как пойдут пуговицы \nизготовлять — так сразу застегнутые все станут ходить наглухо. \nИ потребуются перламутры в количествах — только подтаскивай. \nИ откроют при фабричке точку, но не коньков, а приемную, и начнут от населения всей державы ракушки брать, ибо довольно-таки \nв них перламутров скрывается. А кто более остальных полезного \nсдаст, того фабричка челноком подарит. По-хорошему тебе говорю, \nголос был, не ленись, собирай сокровища. Много бродил я и много \nужинал и ракушек опустошил — несть числа. Створок порожних, \nблагоустроенных ладошек нищенских на манер, створок бесценных, \nс исподу матовых, припрятал — страсть. Прятал открыто, разбрасывая по земле, потому что вещь, на виду лежащая, — она укромней \nвсего лежит. Так что Вы, эту тайну выведав, чур-чура, не приходуйте перлы мои, буде обрящете. Ну, в руках повертеть — повертите, \nзапрещать не хочу, но повертели — и кладите назад, где взяли, иначе Карл-у-Клары-украл-кораллы получится. Настоящее прошу передать по команде, чтобы усвоили, табакуры же в первый ряд. А то \nмоду взяли — все под пепельницы приспосабливать. Ужо им, настанет, знаете ли, некоторый день. Как завижу — баржи с пилильщиками поволокли бревенчук пиля́ть, то хватаю мешок поуемистей да \nпоцелей и чешу торопливым аллюром по бивуакам старопрежних \nпиров. Соберу, сдам по адресу — ладья моя. Не худой, все заметят, \nИлья себе челночок прикукóбил, не так себе. А вы как думали, \nя скажу, полагали — лыком я шит, дулей делан? надеялись — мякина у точильщика в котелке? Нет, завистники, нет, нехалявые, это \nлишь с виду я юноша немудро́й, понарошке только к навозу жмусь. \nСветлое будущее у меня настанет тогда с яликом личным. Вот когда \nмы за ягодами лесными в Заволчье повадимся, грибники записные. \nА то я приглашаю радушно, а с транспортом напряженка. Все же \nверю — в свое время и на ту сторону попадем, давайте лишь выдержку отработаем. Сапоги, повторяю, достаньте — кровь из носу, крапивой щиколки обстрекать по лощинам — пара пустяков, да и змея \nв буераках держится. Да, и дождевик прихватите, вдруг дождь. Здравия желаем, долговязый Вы мой в макинтоше и в кепаре, залезайте, \nкорма скучает по Вам. Мяты, медуницы, болиголова я там подстелил, чтобы пахло недурно, чтобы ненужный запах отбить. И отчаливаем наконец с прибаутками. А верней, Вы в последний момент \nзакапризничали, отказались — и я в одиночестве отвалил. Отвалил \nя пошляться в свои мировые орешники, которые завещал мне однажды осенью один старожил. Завещал, показал, а к весне отойти \nпредпочел он к умершим. Но орешники действительно хоть куда, \nв гранке каждой орехов — что у приблудной козы, не в обиду ей будет \nсказано, под хвостом катяхов. Правда, к стыду моему, ни разу я после имение это недвижимое не навестил. Что за притча, зачем я туда не направлюсь уже на артельском челне? А затем, что пропили \nмы артельский артельным же способом раз двадцать пять. Пареной \nрепе подобен, но всякую снасть или живность дозволяет пустить \nв оборот не единожды. Нету денег порой; ничего, дело ихнее, зато \nесть кот. Не у нас, понятно, точильщиков, нам ни к чему, мышь железа пока не кушает, у мельника, видите ли, имеется кот. И прикидывается один из шатии перехожим каликою и переходит к мельнику на бугор: какое это село тут будет у вас? Не обессудь, Малокулебяково, мол. А я думал — Мыломукомолово тут будет у вас. \nНет, Мыкомулоломово — песня давняя, Мыкомулоломовым мы \nпрежде звались. Хм, а Милокурелемово в таком варианте где? Малокулелёмово, рече, в другой стороне совсем, у нас мало никогда не \nкулёмали. И покуда он с мельником чепуховину эту мелет, пролазы \nнаши за амбаром кота караулят с мешком. Кличет мельник на туманной заре ангорца сибирского, бродит, зычный, по-над Итиль-рекой, а тот — далече. Не дрейфь, растяпа, в добрые руки починщики \nего сбудут с рук. Сразу и новая смена рукава засучает. Верю, и сотрудники не подведут, мурлыку у покупателя со двора сведут тем \nже способом. Сходственная катавасия наблюдалась и с челноком. \nНе скажу теперь, у кого мы его впервой утянули, слишком событие \nудалено, да и не суть это важно. Замечу только — сплавляли затем \nмногажды и регулярно, и тоже всенепременно понятливым. Напоследок, однако, срезались, осрамились, загнали весьма безответственному. По совершению купчей, после заката, в куриную слепоту \nвозникаем, как тать, у прибрежных колов, где, по сведениям прогнозов, сударь сей лодку нашу намеревался держать. Смотрим — \nнет плоскодонки, лишь груда щепы лежит. Выясняется. Меж тем \nкак мы с беднягой торговлю вели, у него как раз баньку обчистили. \nКовш забрали, мочало, обмылок и казано́к. И сетку заодно выдрали \nиз ручья, поскольку баня та при ручье. Егерята промыслили, сомнений на этот счет не лелеем. И когда покупатель приплыл на обнове домой и обнаружил ущерб — он тогда весь затрясся. Зачем \nсмеешься, черемисы одни спросили, посиживали невдалеке, за воротник закладывая: что ли, весело? Как же мне не смеяться, Вася \nэтот — потому что это был он — отвечал. Как же мне не смеяться, \nон отвечал, сквозил мне в буреломе судьбины разъединственный \nогонек — мережа, дыра на дыре, и мечтал в рыбаки податься, дощеник все желал прикупить. И проследите: то челн укé — снасть э-э́, \nа то челн э-э — снасть уке, ее выкрали. Нет, неправильно Михей \nМарафетин учил, будто всякий ставит брату своему сеть; здесь картина обратная: ты, брат, ставишь, а брат твою сетку тащит. И сотвори Василий топор и поруби наш струг за ненадобностью в ликованьи сердешном. Вот и обезлодили мы на старице лет, прогуляли \nушкуй свой артельным путем безвыгодно. Как же, говорит, не смеяться.\n\nВсе-таки, положим, Фомич, промыслили мы с Вами посудину. \nСнарядились, достали и сапоги, и лукошко, и плащ; и что характерно — я отвалил, а Вы воздержались. Я всполошился: загрипповали, \nхвораете? Нет, здоровье по норме, хлопоты просто по службе наметились — с письмишком твоим спешу ознакомиться, а грибы мои, \nк сожалению, меня подождут. Истина Ваша, синица верней журавля; ознакомьтесь, вселите надежды великодушно. Отпихнулся чем \nводится — и пошел жуком-водомером безвредным рывками ширь \nмерять. Точно как чибисы, уключины плачут, ничуть не смазаны. \nЗамечаете, погодка установилась — шепчет, давешней не чета. Не \nстрельнуть ли у Вас по этому случаю двоечку папирос, одну в зубы, \nвторую за ухо, про запас. Лепота невозможная. Бор — красный, лес — \nлис с подпалинами, Итиль — медом потек перламутровым — ложкой ешь. И вода просвечена, что луной, и видимо-невидимо пустылок \nна дне, и нашлепку любую читаешь ярлычную запросто, как сквозь \nприлавка стекло. Поднырнуть бы, собрать бы сосуды бесхозные — \nда в Слободу. А? Что Вы, шутейные все мечтания, глубоко непомерно, а вовсе не водолазы мы. Вот пиявкам — доступно, сосут. А караси-то здесь где, ерши эти самые? Пригляделся — кемарили в ямах, \nв тени берегов, под корягами, и Орина плыла надо мной, ляжки свои \nразводя по-лягушьи совсем. Будто в зеркале плыла она наверху, \nбудто блазнилась, и волосы длинные тянулись, как тина, вдоль боков и спины, гру́ди же — чтоб не соврать — ходили парой крупных \nлиней меж рыб. Из далекой близи моей мог без зазрения совести \nвпечатление от женщины получить и рассматривал всю, поскольку \nхватало воздуху, а когда не хватало — выплыву, подышу и назад. \nСта́тью своей разбитной нарочито гусей дразнила в Илье, но характер держал, не давая нервам амнистии, и терпенье хранил горделиво — дразни-дразни, нам, сиротам, не привыкать, мы вытерпим. Но \nпоимей в виду: как набью я оскомину долгой мольбой, как принужу \nтебя, курносую, по всем статьям — уж попарю я, паря безродный, \nкорягу плоти моей бессовестно, поманежу, как следует быть. Что ракушек касается, то и они, они тоже там были раскиданы. Эти просто \nраскиданы, лежали, отсвечивая, иные ползли старательно, неизвестно куда, и при том оставляли на грунте податливом, зыбком такие \nследы, будто Горыныч напо́лзал их, тонины́ небольшой. Спички \nи соль, намекаете, имел ли я при себе? Не совсем: в числе остальных \nспециальностей находились в одеждах, а те, в свой черед, в скабиозах, в чапыжниках. До искалеченья — и даже поздней — до той бобылочки вплоть, которая пистоны позастрочила намертво, дабы руками я попусту в карманах не шуровал, все достоянье хранил я обычай прадедов там содержать. Ныне манатки складирую частью в суму, \nчастью в пустую штанину подвязанную — комфорт. Не было бы, \nговорит, удачи, да неудача была. Ну и вот. Что предсказывал я Орине в уме — то и сделалось. Навещаю по старому стилю того же июля \nчисла, понимаете ли, двадцатого, у Ильи именины, а у нее выходной \nотгул. Неужели в апартаментах торчать — айда пошляемся. Пятый \nчас. Воздух стыл его слабый, трогательный, но ляги, поди ж ты, расквакались как ненормальные, зачуяли настроенье мое. Было мелочью рублей при себе четырнадцать, на станции с утра насшибал. Из \nних под платформой только обрел до рубля — растереха еще у нас \nпассажир. И вообще красота под перроном, уютно — коптишь, покашливаешь, и всем на тебя наплевать, где ты есть или, может быть, \nкто. Наоборот, ты сквозь щели меж досками любопытствуешь и провидишь все досконально; некоторые, к примеру, барышни вообще \nпочему-то без нижнего. Ну и Орина аванец накануне взяла — гуляй, \nрванина. Был-имелся в те хитрые годы как годы трактир — не трактир, лабаз — не лабаз, а давай читать — забегаловка. Отстояла она \nот бараков — рукой подать, ближе близкого, фрамугами лупилась на \nтракт. Отоварились — и приютились за дамбой, в акациях, в самой \nдреме. Оре я, как не нами заведено, лапсердак подстелил, сам — \nпросто так. Закусили; таранька азовская вяленая, третий сорт, — та \nи сейчас перед глазами стоит. Спели, попели, потом я несколько рискованных приключений на память привел. А замолаживало, гроза \nот хранилища заходила, и пожалел я об этой затее своей, потому что \nдостали нас — прямо достали квакухи хором большим. Мыслил \nя тучи вспять завернуть, да лень одолела, назюзился и размяк. Бог \nс ней, думаю, пускай гремит, скрытная вода в облацех, авось пронесет. Ан пролилось. На поляне пристигло нас, у самых качель. Поугрюмело все, зашаталось, закапало. Побежали, торопит. Сама на берег влечет. Там карбас перевернутый ничейный на гальке валялся \nничком, и рогатина невысокая его подпирала под обечайку, чтоб \nможн о было подлезть. Спички подмокли, но кремень и огниво не \nотказали — трут подпалил я в момент. Щепок хрустких и гильз отработанных папиросных — всякой горючей мелочи нашлось в избытке; сварганился огонек. Озарило прекрасно светом этим Орину, \nосияло заодно и Илью, и пошли по обводам шершавым тени наши \nходить. Шел бабай по стене, нес семеро лаптей, и себе, и жене, и дитенку по лаптенку, я ей, помню, сказал. Хлынь обшивку когтит и когтит, а нам — сухо, беседуем, на ветоши прилегли. Посвятил ты меня \nв свои случаи, подруга мне говорит, а желаешь — и я тебе что-либо \nповедаю.\n",

  content: "A friend of the family, a courier clerk, whose ancestors, Sicilian negotiators, once arrived in Russia for \na shipment of tarantassi and, on their way back, got \nstuck forever in the impassable mud somewhere between \nKonotop and Syzran, and whose portrait shines by its absence \nin the exposition, shows interest in our hero. When the latter, \nin the words of the first, reaches the required level of respectability, the public servant advises the young man to follow in \nhis footsteps and through his protection makes it possible for \nhim to enroll in the courier institute. The fate of the artist had \nbeen decided. His face, possessing features of refined sensuality, attracted attention by its clear expression of character. Particularly during parades and reviews. Particularly equine ones. \nIn those moments, he would become twice as energetic and \nproud. In contrast, the physiognomies of the remaining riders \nwere mediocre; the ears of many, seemingly in order to catch \nthe clatter of the hooves better, were hopelessly sticking out. \nFrom the windows of the classroom every hour—a river cesspool, and often the enthusiastic youngster dares to sail on it in \na monstrous trough. How obtrusively paper and slime drag \nafter the blades of oars! Yanko is not afraid of the wind or waves; \nwhen he grows up, he will appear in the twilight of his life as a \nmaster cook in the cooking joint slippery from grease. Methodical stirring with a ladle and whirling of foul-smelling slop \nwill suddenly vividly resemble the pictures from the carefree \npast, from the period of lonely boat races with himself—feverish and frail—when in the morning, the mugs of the neighboring buildings, yawning in the dirty-yellow hospital dankness of \nthe outskirts’ fogs, make you feel faint and when that—true, \npockmarked, and rotten-toothed—girl behind the plywood \npartition, setting out to her defectological universities, snivels \nabout her school-writing accessories that scattered all over the \nfloor, and sings without a tune and without end: Rain, dear rain, \nplease be done, I will go to Arestan—eleven years old, harelipped, conceived in a drunken stupor—and you, at the dawn \nof your deprived youth, are waking up, covered with peels and \npetals of whitewash dropping from the ceiling, you’re waking \nup, trying to understand: Is it you or someone else waking up \nright there, and not knowing: Is it he or someone else, for instance—precisely you, but also a neglected weakling who is \nwaking up here, doomed to miseries of the anemic day, while \nmother rustles with a newspaper, swooshes with her coat, \nscratches with the key, and goes out to become an accountant \nin the haberdashery named after the politician Razin: Stepan \nTimofeevich, where the heck did you put the ledger? And \nmeanwhile, a poorly cut, yet solidly sewn dashing military instructor in suspenders, having beforehand dressed the chair in \nan impeccably ironed French coat, walked among the courier \nmachines typical for the years of the campaign. He was arriving \nbright-faced, ruddy like all guardsmen, with a couple of fearless, seemingly filled with terror, ashen bulging eyes. Portrait of \na Military Instructor. He walked with narrow, laden steps, and, \ndropping morsels of Morse code, announced that the first use \nof a tank in battle took place during the Indian summer of 1916 \non the Bzura. War. The air is gray, listless, and serene. Rain fell \na day before; the sleepy front-line plants are slowly stripping. \nAnd when the gunfire calms down, one can hear how the stiff \nand heavy leaves of the oak tree in the grove fall, nose-diving, \nand the crows chatter in the same grove on the hill, marked on \ntopographical maps as number two hundred seventeen. Besides that, one can hear that in the sawmill someone is sawing \nwith a saw and someone is screeching on a concertina. And in \nthe trenches and ditches of the enemy, beyond the tangled, terribly corroded barbed wires, beyond the small pile of motley, \nmultinational, bare-toothed, and barefooted corpses, the Austrian flutes, in counterpoint with the Magyar drums, whistle \nthe annoying “Kaiser’s Hunting March,” utterly alien to the \nRussian heart. In one word, toward winter the view from the \nclassroom’s window becomes too repetitive. And it is apparent \nthat the more you study it, the more static it gets. And does not \nevery Homo sapiens that is hurrying somewhere resemble \nAchilles? Nobody is able to catch up with one’s tortoise, reach \nsomething close by, whatever it could be. A survey of the late \nfall. Occupation—a passerby. Place of work—the street. The \nlength of employment in the given field—eternity. The situation is not better with the other moving objects—they are not \nmoving, making everything questionable. The migration of \nflocks lasts unacceptably long. They soar above the ribbed, \ndark maroon roofs, barely waving their wings. There is a wind \norchestra in the park, but on the benches—many free seats. \nNaturally, the sound is flowing as if the gramophone completely lost its breath. Let it be so. The same about movement \nof every kind; more precisely—non-movement, about the \nstatic character of the entire Winter’s Eve in the City: Let it be \nso. Literature lessons were going on. The shoes of the teacher, \non which, like a pair of used-up lonely accordions, descended \nthe socks, were unusually worn out, they were wrecked. It \nseemed you were looking at the footwear of an inveterate \nwalker, an enthusiastic pilgrim, a wandering cripple, and perhaps even the very Ahasuerus—the celebrated shoemaker \nwithout a shoe shop, the one who gained world fame by his \nimpulsiveness, and who admitted his mistake but still got what \nhe deserved. And yet, as for the static character of the winter’s \neve in the city: Let it be so. But unexpectedly on the screen of \nthe window unfolded the black-and-white silent movie of The \nFirst Snowfall and if the street until now has not offered to the \ndowncast eyes any energetic subjects, be so kind and find \nthem, display them, imagine them for yourself, and project \nthem on the screen without delay. Here are for you newspaper \nboys in once-fashionable plaid kepi, shouting out sensational \nheadlines. Much obliged, but you are not taking into account \nthat sensations have been officially banned, these boys have retired, and the newspapers are sold only in kiosks. In that case, \nshow the former boys that now turned into a living embodiment of untreatable illnesses, and as far as sensations— \nbecause of the lack of the present ones—collect yesterday’s. \nHere they are, the little devils, rushing down the bridge along \nthe cast-iron Imperial railings with eagles, trying to peddle to \nthe encountered Achilleses the so-called fresh issues. By the \nway, rushing is a strong word; however, in comparison with the \nAchilleses, they are almost rushing. And notice that some of \nthem are traveling on invalids’ carts, and one had already been \ndressed for the last journey: The oaken burden had been placed \non runners, and the co-workers of the deceased are dragging it \nover the fresh powder. How do you find their faces? They are \nworn out. Did time have no mercy on them? Absolutely not. \nWell, and their souls? Alas, their souls are maimed beyond recognition, simply not worth a broken farthing. The march of \ngloomy subjects with the fangs yellow from acorn coffee in \ntheir wrinkled mouths, carrying under their arms bundles of \nsheets yellowed by spite and false accusations, convulsing like \nSaint Vitus and maliciously grimacing, was making the mercantile move along the route of the A-tram. The so-called white \nflies were swarming above the peddlers, blinding them, tickling their blackhead-covered, overripe noses, and sticking to \ntheir shoulders like dandruff. The distributors kept tripping on \nthe bumpy ground, falling, struggling, spilling their cargo, and, \nto collect it, crawling on all fours with a guilty look. After all, \nthey were very heavy, these dirt-cheap bundles. But perhaps \nthey were not newspapers at all, perhaps the retirees carried for \nsale histories of their illnesses—such heavy ones—of such serious ones? No, no, these were exactly newspapers—histories \nof the illnesses of history—such heavy ones—of such serious \nones, and the histories of their own illnesses the paper boys \ncarried inside; they were themselves histories of these diseases. \nPoor codgers, for a long time they were unable to conquer the \nbarely noticeable hump in the pavement—black ice! Almost \nreaching the summit, the co-workers, one after another, slid \ndown holding their historical load, and some of them managed \nto keep staying on their feet, while the others did not. After sliding down to the bottom, they undertook the new ascent and \nslid again—Sisyphus after Sisyphus: What fun! And now provide the sound. Fine, catch it! First, whizzing and moaning, \nasthmatic cough, shuffling of footwear, clearing of throats, sobbing, etc. After that, someone who lost something yells: So \nwhere is my something? In response—silence, everybody is \ntoo busy, everybody is captivated by the process of movement; \nit is a procession. The procedure of dragging the improvised \ncatafalque—the sounds of the dragging. A shout: Fresh news! \nA scream: Russian Gazette! Then all at once, but different \nthings: The Voice! New Times! Stock Exchange Circular! St. \nPetersburg Leaflet! Panting with pneumatic braking mechanisms, the streetcar catches up with and passes the presssellers, and the bustling mumble of the twelve pairs of wheels, \neven though its sounds are muted by the snow flurries, deafens \nthis dissonant roar. Finally, the last car showed the veterans its \noval-shaped cockroach butt, with a protruding and swinging \nsausage of the turnbuckle, with the letter A, walking in agronomist’s arshin-wide steps, and with moping human mugs behind the dull round windows of the car’s vestibule. The clock \nabove the gate of the park of cultural recreation was attesting to \nthe most boring stretch of the day—the spades trumped one \no’clock and made a lead to two. Night visited Japan, and karatekas of Hokkaido, having shouted enough “Ha,” wallowed on \ntheir tatami. In China, dogs’ heads were being cut off. Turkey \nsmelled of coffee and tobacco. In Albania, despite the earthquake, by the house of the patriot Kastrioti, a mob of dark- \ncomplexioned gawkers rejoiced. Romania was curing its hangover with Rymnikskoye wine, legs were becoming light and \nwent dancing by themselves, and nobody knew whether it is \nTuesday or Thursday. The unemployed Italy merrily rode under the olive trees on stolen velocycles, and the lira, as always, \nwas not worth a spit. Lighthouses and sirens of Gibraltar heartened seafarers riding out a storm, and here, in Russia, in the \nformer merry village Botfortovo, the retired newspaper tomboys attempted to get rid of retired news. Meeting of the Emperors in Holstein! Bashi-bazouks slaughtered fifteen thousand in Bulgaria! All is calm on Shipka! Trans-Siberian railroad \nfinished! Tsai Hsun condemned to hara-kiri! Evacuation in \nManchuria! Incident in Casablanca! Go out—willy-nilly, with \na heavy soul, tumbleweed rolls freely and jumps like a ball, dictated Ahasuerus. The pens worked diligently. Parcae and \nMoirae condemned the students to courier life, and in front of \nthem were all the riches of the world. It was getting light. In \nLapland the cows had not been milked yet, in Nazareth the \nmuezzin had not cried out yet, but in the hunting cottage of the \nFrench king, revelers were still drinking Chartreuse. Having \nfinished prattling about the courtesans and balls, they stumbled out with their goblets on the balcony and, grabbing the \nhorn from each other’s hands, bellowed to the stars a complaint of the young bull killed at the Catalan corrida. Afterward, they shot into the air: The shots were heard as far as Versailles. The borzois there were nervous and barked from time \nto time; the guards kept shuddering and waking up. Fräuleins \nin peignoirs and with night lamps in their hands gossiped in \nthe galleries: Oh, mon Dieu, when will he finally settle down—\nmonarque, but behaves like Pierrot. Friends, the one mentioned announces, standing close to the balustrade, surrounded \nby the cortege and the dog pack, I propose a toast to this daredevil who will empty in one gulp the barrel of my musket, filled \nwith Burgundy. The weapon is brought out. Its butt is richly \ninlaid. The host puts it in the hands of one of the participants: \nGive it a try, mon cher. A failure befalls the Graf; he is unable to \ndrink even a half. The barrel is refilled and, to the accompaniment of the hunters’ laughter, given to the next of them. He \nalso suffers a fiasco. The musket is moving in a circle and the \ncircle, finally, closes—only the first among equals has not yet \ntested his skill. Frenchmen, he says, your benevolent Ludovic \nis hastening to your rescue. Right now he will empty the vessel, \nalthough in a manner completely different than yours—just \nwatch. The monarch plugs the barrel with a cork and pours \nsome Dutch powder on the flashpan. Deathly pallor covers the \nfaces of those present. Your—they scream in terror, moving to \nthe sides; the king shoots (the musket explodes) and falls \ndown; everybody anxiously runs to the outstretched body— \nHighness! Ludovic is silent, his wonderful visage, painted hundreds of times by European masters, is disfigured and the snowwhite masquerade costume—completely bespattered. Ah, my \nlittle boy, whispers the queen who woke up for a moment in \nher boudoir from the distant gunshot that reminded her of a \npop of a carnival popgun, my sweet mischief-maker. The white \ncurls of the beautiful hair of Her Majesty are spread over her \nhigh-piled pillows; she is having a sad dream: A brazen boar \nwith the physiognomy of the hunchbacked whipper-in, whom \nshe despises, rapturously caresses her in the shadow of the camellias next to the baths. Having accomplished the evil deed, \nthe lascivious game vanishes in the thicket. Shame and disgust \nseize the queen. She has a feeling that some of the wardens that \nwere hiding in the gazebo and were the clandestine witnesses \nof the indecent scene, would want to make fun of her most august disgrace. It was getting light. The investigator for special \ncases, Pozhilykh, a specialist without any kind of special identifying marks, wore a convertible coat-tent and a field bag \nacross his shoulder. In the bag—standard document blanks, a \ntightly rolled-up saber sheath, a pocket flashlight, a measuring \ntape, a magnifying glass, a fountain pen, a detailed map of the \narea, and an eyeglass holder, in which, beneath the lining, lies a \nphotograph of the female worker of the local public library that \nholds in its collection about a hundred grayish volumes. Pozhilykh’s Sunday. Supper, vermouth, clouds of smoke. Tobacco is \nmoist and has a combined aftertaste of cologne and kerosene—a result of carelessness of those responsible for packaging, storing, and shipping. Eyes are drawn to scrambled eggs \nwith sausage, laberdan, and a can of very salty Caspian sardines. \nOne can distinguish the month of the catch and the day of salting, one can also read the Turkic signature of the controller. \nAmong furniture, besides chairs and a table, there is a settee, \nnarrow and uncomfortable in every respect. And a simple \nsideboard—made of walnut. On the shelves—a few plates and \nsaucers and a few slightly moldy pieces of bread. One can also \nnotice there a container with office glue—to seal the windows. \nCut the paper strips from the newspaper margins, and glue \nthem on before the first frosts. The view from one of the inspector’s windows reveals a wooden shed, full of cracks; the view \nfrom the other—the same shed. In summer, when the window \nframes are wide open, there is a smell of honeysuckle and elder, \nthe aroma of chopped wood, and the sounds of a shaded side \nstreet—a fly, a moped, a tarantas, and the steps of a resident. Being a representative of the office of the prosecutor, Pozhilykh lies \ndown around ten. He reads in bed a journal published in the capital, not shirking verses and poems, and frequently reciting from \nmemory what sank in, what he remembers. Particularly—As I \nDrove Up to Izhory. Moreover, he imagines Izhory as a large \nwooden town on a hill in the middle of a spacious parched pasture. Across the field, orange-tinted like a pumpkin, under the \npleasant sky of a not very warm midday, rolls the dormeuse with \ncrude shock absorbers made from forged iron. The passenger, \ndark-skinned and lively, with carelessly combed curly sideburns, \nleans out and, gently holding his top hat with his hand, engages \nin recollections: I remembered our story, glances of your dark \nblue eyes. Izhory is getting closer and the golden cupolas keep \ngleaming. In case of a trip beyond the boundaries of the district, \nespecially if in the pearly dampness of the mist, brightly glowing, \nsoars a trace of a strange deceit, or it is just cold, he puts on a \nwind-shielding padded jacket and a felt cloak of solid construction. Having spent the night, he gives an order to harness the \nhorses, and right away. Clinking is heard, it is getting light. Eh, I \nwill give you a ride over the bumps, the driver with eyes resembling the rabbit’s, in a fox-skin coat, rapaciously baring teeth in his \nwolf’s muzzle, winks from the driver’s bench. And it is true—the \nroad is not blacktopped. On the right, one and a half or maybe \neven more verstas away—there is a river. Beyond the river—a village with many bathhouses and boats on the shore. The church is \nfully reflected. Reflected are also the crows, swarming around the \nbelfry like black pieces of fabric cut by a tailor and lifted up by the \nzephyr. The given village, if one were to trust the maps, has a long \nand senseless name. One can hear in it the whirring movement of \na mill’s grinding wheel; it seems to wave from afar the quadriga of \nits wings, not aware of their other, lofty purpose. One can also \nhear the sounds of loading; tapping with their boots and grunting on the entire middle of August, some laborers are carrying \nwhitish five-pood bundles and order the one standing on the \nwagon: Here, grab them! He truly scrambles. In addition, \nin the given name glimmers the speech impairment of the \nmiller’s helper, a dimwit and spindle-legs, who, answering your \nquestion—What village is this?—says nothing, only keeps \nsucking a lollipop on a stick and, as if nothing happened, turns \ninto ice your visiting soul with the stare practiced around Izhory. \nFor a musical ear, our name reverberates with the entire symphony; after all, one can also discover in it the voice of the miller \nhimself who, having heard the above-mentioned conversation, \nhurries to provide assistance—if we can only say such a thing \nabout a person who barely walks, being burdened by the overabundance of health—hurries to assist the one with the speech \nimpairment. But the miller himself also seems to have stuffed his \nmouth with something—most likely with some millstones, because the grains of his words are pouring on the traveler with the \nflour of noise. And it does not help that in a moment the hallowed \nname will flash in the fog: To determine clearly—is it Malokulebyakovo or Mylokulelemovo—there is not enough perspicacity.\n",

  content: "Друг семьи, разъездной чиновник, чьи предки, сицилианские \nнегоцианты, прикатили когда-то в  Россию за партией tarantasi \nи, возвращаясь, навечно застряли в непролазной грязи где-то меж \nКонотопом и Сызранью и чей портрет блистает отсутствием в экспозиции, принимает участие в нашем герое. Когда последний, по \nвыражению первого, входит в действительный курс респектации, \nчиновник рекомендует юноше пуститься по своим стопам и составляет ему протекцию для поступления в разъездное училище. Судьба художника была решена. Лик его, наделенный приметами изысканной чувственности, обращал на себя внимание ясной высказанностью характера. Особенно в ходе парадов и смотров. Особенно \nконных. Когда становился вдвойне энергичен и горделив. Физиономии же остальных наездников были посредственны, уши у многих, словно бы для того, чтобы лучше улавливать цокот копыт, безнадежно оттопыривались. Из окон класса всякий час — река-клоака, и зачастую восторженный отрок дерзает морячить по ней на \nмонструозном корыте. Как неотвязно за лопастями весел тянется \nи бумага, и тина! Янко не боится ни ветра, ни волн, вырастет — очнется в сумерках бытия кухмистером скользкой от сала кухмистерской. \nМетодическое помешивание черпаком, коловращение скверно пахнущих жиж вдруг живо напомнят картины беспечной давности, пору лодочных одиночных гонок с самим собой — воспаленным, мозглявым, когда по утрам хари окрестных строений обморочно зияют \nв грязно-желтой больничной мокроте окраинных растуманов и та — \nверно, рябая и гнилозубая — девочка за фанерною перепонкой, собираясь в свои дефектологические университеты, хнычет над рассыпавшимися по полу школьно-письменными принадлежностями и поет безмотивно и нескончаемо — дождик-дождик, перестань, \nя поеду в Арестань: одиннадцатилетняя, заячьегубая, пьянозачатая, — \nа ты на заре своей бедной юности просыпаешься, обсыпанный цыпками и лепестками белил, отлетевшими от потолка, просыпаешься, \nстараясь понять: ты ли это или кто-то другой просыпается тут и не \nзнает: он ли это или кто-то другой, например — тот же ты, но такой \nже затурканный рахитос просыпается здесь, обреченный невзгодам \nмалокровного дня, а мать шелестит газетой, шуршит плащом, хрустит замком и уходит в бухгалтеры в пошивочную имени политика \nРазина: Степан Тимофеич, куда вы задевали гроссбух? Между тем \nсреди разъездных механизмов образца батальных годов шагал неладно скроенный да крепко пошитый лихой военрук в подтяжках, \nпредупредительно облачив стул в добросовестно отутюженный френч. \nПрибывал доброутренний, по-гвардейски румяный, с четою бесстрашных, словно бы полных ужаса, пепловатых навыкате глаз. Портрет \nвоенрука. Шагал нешироко, оловянно и, морося морзянкой, доносил, что первое применение танка в бою произошло бабьим летом \nшестнадцатого на Бзуре. Война. Воздух сер, равнодушен, недвижим. \nДождь перепал накануне, сонные прифронтовые растения медленно \nобнажаются. И когда стрельба затихает, слышно, как слетают, пикируя, по-жестяному тяжелые листья дуба в дуброве, и базарят воро́ны \nв той же дуброве на высоте, обозначенной на топографических картах \nотметкою двести семнадцать. Кроме того, слышно, как на лесопильне кто-то пилит пилою, а некто пиликает на концертино. А в траншеях и сапах противника, за спутанными, ужасно окислившимися \nи колючими проволоками, за кучей-малой разношерстных, разноплеменных ощерившихся и босых мертвяков, австрийские флейты, \nконтрапунктируя с мадьярскими барабанами, высвистывают надоедный Марш Кайзеровских Охотников, чуждый русскому сердцу \nдонельзя. Словом, к зиме вид из окна класса делается слишком однообразен. И разве не очевидно, что он тем статичнее, чем более \nизучаешь его. И не всяк ли спешащий путем своим Ахиллу подобен: \nникто не в состоянии догнать свою черепаху, достичь ближайшего \nчего-то, чего бы то ни. Анкета глубокой осени. Профессия — прохожий. Место работы — улица. Стаж работы по специальности — вечность. Не лучше получается и с другими принципиально способными перемещаться объектами — они не перемещаются, убеждая сомневаться во всем. Непозволительно затягивается перелет стай. Над \nребристыми мутно-бордовыми кровлями парят они, чуть пошевеливая крылами. В парке — духовой оркестр, но свободных мест на \nскамейках — полным полно. Естественно, что звук плывет, как если \nбы граммофон напрочь выдохся. Пусть. То же относительно всякого \nрода движения, а верней — недвижения, относительно статичности \nвсего Городского Предзимья: пусть. Шли уроки словесности. Башмаки этого преподавателя, на которые парой использованных одиноких гармошечек нисползали носки, были на редкость изношены, \nбыли разбиты. Сдавалось, вы зрите обувь заядлого ходока, завзятого пилигрима, калики, а то и самого Агасфера — известного сапожника без сапожной, снискавшего своей опрометчивостью вселенскую \nславу — раскаявшегося, но получившего-таки поделом. Но относительно статичности городского предзимья — пусть. Но неожиданно \nна экране окна пошло черно-белое немое кино Первоснежья, и если \nулица до сих пор не дарит унылому взору энергичных субъектов, \nблаговолите найти их, представить, вообразить самому себе и не \nмешкая спроецировать на экран. Нате в некогда модных клетчатых \nкепи мальчишек-газетчиков, вопящих сенсационные шапки. Благодарю вас, но вы не учитываете, что сенсации официально отменены, \nте мальчишки ушли на покой и газеты продаются только в киосках. \nЗначит, следует показать бывших мальчиков, ставших ныне живым \nвоплощением неизлечимых недугов, а сенсаций — за неимением нынешних — набрать вчерашних. Вон они, мальчуганы, чешут по мосту вдоль чугунных имперских с орлами решеток, пытаясь сбагрить \nвстречным ахиллам так называемые свежие номера. Впрочем, чешут — сказано сильно; однако в сравненьи с ахиллами даже и чешут. Обратите внимание, некоторые передвигаются на инвалидных \nколясках, а одного обрядили уже в последний путь: дубовую обузу \nпоставили на полозья и сослуживцы почившего влекут ее по свежей пороше. Как вы находите эти лица? Они затасканы. Неужели \nвремя не пощадило их? Никоим образом. Так-с, а души? Увы, души \nискалечены до неузнаваемости, просто гроша ломаного не дашь. \nМарш угрюмых субъектов с желтыми от желудевого кофе клыками \nв морщинистых ртах, с пачками пожелтевших от злости и лживых \nнападок листков под мышками, виттово конвульсируя и жестоко \nгримасничая, совершал продажный ход по маршруту А-трэма. Так \nназываемые белые мухи роились над разносчиками, слепили их, \nщекотали им угреватые, переспелые их носы и, как перхоть, облепляли их плечи. Распространители спотыкались о земные неровности, \nпадали, шлепались, рассыпали несомое и, чтобы собрать, на карачках \nползали виновато. Все-таки они были очень тяжелые, те грошовые \nкипы. Но может, то были совсем не газеты, может, пенсионеры вынесли на продажу истории своих болезней — такие тяжелые — таких \nтяжелых? Нет-нет, то были как раз газеты — истории болезней истории — такие тяжелые — таких тяжелых, а истории собственных болезней газетчики носили в себе, сами являясь историями этих заболеваний. Бедные престарелые: они долго не могли одолеть чуть \nзаметную горбинку замостия — гололедица. Едва не достигая вершины, сотрудники по очереди соскальзывали вниз вместе со своим историческим грузом, причем одни удерживались на ногах, но \nне другие. Съехав к подножью, предпринимали новое восхождение \nи снова съезжали — сизиф за сизифом: потеха! А теперь дайте звук. \nЗабирайте. Сначала хрипы и стоны, астматический кашель, шарканье \nобуви, харканье, всхлипыванья и т. п. После кто-нибудь что-нибудь \nпотерявший вопит: да где же мое что-нибудь! Ответом — безмолвие, всем недосуг, каждый увлечен процессом движенья — процессия. Процедура влачения импровизированного катафалка — звуки \nвлачения. Крик: свежие новости! Клик: Русские Ведомости! Затем \nвсе разом, но разное: Голос! Новое Время! Биржевая! Петербургский \nлисток! Сопение пневматических тормозных устройств — трамвай \nнагоняет и обгоняет прессопродавцев, и хлопотное лопотанье двенадцати пар колес, хоть и звучащее под сурдинку снегопада, глушит \nэтот нестройный ор. Наконец последний вагон показал ветеранам \nовальный тараканий зад с торчащей и ворочающейся колбаской фаркопфа, с буквой А, шагающей агрономическим аршином, и с хмурыми человечьими мордами за мутными бычьими пленками тамбур-площадки. Часы над воротами парка культурного отдыха свидетельствовали наиболее скушное время суток — пики откозыряли \nчас и зашли под второй. Японию навестила ночь, и каратисты Хоккайдо, нахыкавшись, дрыхли на своих татами. В Китае рубили собачьи головы. Турция пахла кофе и табаком. В Албании, несмотря \nна землетрясение, у дома, где жил патриот Кастриоти, ликовала \nтолпа смугловатых зевак. Румыния опохмелялась рымникским, ноги делались легкими и сами пускались в пляс, никто не ведал, вторник или четверг. Безработная Италия весело ехала под оливами \nна похищенных велоциклетах, и лира, как всегда, ни черта не стоила. Маяки и ревуны Гибралтара бодрили штормующих мареманов, \nа тут, в России, в бывшей потешной деревне Ботфортово, отставные \nгазетные сорванцы тщились сбыть отставные новости. Свидание \nимператоров в Гоштейне! Башибузуки вырезали пятнадцать тысяч \nв Болгарии! На Шипке все спокойно! Сибирская дорога построена! \nЦзай-Сюнь приговорен к харакири! Эвакуация Маньчжурии! Инцидент в Касабланке! Выйдешь — поневоле тяжело — хоть плачь, \nсмотришь, через поле перекати-поле прыгает, как мяч, диктовал \nАгасфер. Перья старались. Парки и Мойры приговорили учащихся \nк разъездной жизни, и впереди у них было все золото мира. Светало. \nЕще в Лапландии не доили коров, еще в Назарете не кричал муэдзин, а на охотничьей мызе французского короля все еще пили chartreuse. Наболтавшись о куртизанках, балах, с кубками вываливались \nна балкон и, вырывая друг у друга рожок, мычали звездам жалобу \nмолодого быка, заколотого на каталонской корриде. Потом стреляли на воздух: выстрелы были слышны даже в Версале. Борзые \nтам беспокоились, полаивали, стража вздрагивала и просыпалась. \nФрейлины в пеньюарах и с ночниками в руках сплетничали на галереях: о mon Dieu, когда он только остепенится — monarque, а ведет себя, как Pierrot. Друзья, провозглашает тот, стоя у балюстрады \nв окружении свиты и своры, я предлагаю тост за того удальца, который залпом осушит ствол моего мушкета, полный бургундского. \nВыносят. Приклад инкрустирован. Хозяин передает оружие одному \nиз участников: отведайте, mon cher. Графа постигает неудача: он не \nв состоянии выпить и половины. Ствол пополняется и под хохот \nохотников вручается следующему из них. Он также терпит фиаско. \nМушкет идет по кругу, и он наконец замыкается — лишь первый \nсреди равных не испытал еще своих сил. Французы, говорит он, ваш \nлюбезный Людовик спешит вам на выручку. Сейчас он осушит сосуд, хоть и совершенно иным способом, нежели ваш, — следите. Монарх затыкает ствол бутылочной пробкой и насыпает на полку голландского пороху. Лица присутствующих покрывает смертельная \nбледность. Ваше, — в ужасе кричат они, расступаясь, король стреляет (мушкет взрывается) и падает, все в волнении бросаются к распростертому телу, — Величество! Людовик немотствует, его изумительный лик, сотни раз писанный европейскими мастерами, изуродован, а белоснежный маскарадный костюм — весь забрызган. Ах, \nмой мальчик, шепчет королева, на миг пробудившаяся у себя в будуаре от дальнего выстрела, напомнившего ей хлоп карнавальной \nхлопушки, милый мой удалец. Белые локоны прекрасных волос Ее \nВеличества разметались по высоким подушкам, ей снится печальное: дерзкий вепрь с физиономией ненавистного ей горбуна-доезжачего восхищенно ласкает ее под сенью камелии возле купален. Совершив злодеяние, похотливая дичь исчезает в чаще. Стыд \nи омерзение охватывают королеву. Ей мнится, что некоторые из егерей, скрывавшиеся в беседке и бывшие тайными свидетелями недостойной сцены, желали бы насмеяться над ее августейшим бесчестьем. Светало. Следователь по особым делам Пожилых, специалист \nбез каких бы то ни было примет, носил плащ-палатку и полевую \nсумку через плечо. В сумке — стандартные бланки актов, плотно \nскрученная портупея, карманный фонарь, сантиметр, лупа, вечное \nперо, подробная карта местности и очешник, где за подкладкой — \nфотографический снимок работницы местной публички, насчитывающей в своих фондах около ста сыроватых томов. Воскресение \nПожилых. Ужин, вермут, накурено. Табак влажен и носит смешанный привкус одеколона и керосина — следствие нерадивости тех, \nкто ответствен за упаковку, хранение и перевоз. В глаза кидается \nяичница с колбасой, лабардан, банка тюльки каспийской круто соленой. Различаешь число поимки, дату соления, читаешь и тюркскую \nподпись браковщика. Из мебели, помимо стульев, стола, — узкое, \nнеудобное в любом отношении канапе. Буфет орехов и прост. На \nполках — несколько тарелок и блюдец и несколько несколько плесневелых кусочков хлеба. Виднеется и флакон конторского клею — \nзаклеивать окна. Бумажные полоски нарезать из газетных полей, \nклеить до заморозков. Вид из одного следовательского окна — дровяной щелястый сарай, из другого — тот же сарай. Летом при распахнутых рамах — запах жимолости и бузины, аромат разъятого \nдерева, звуки тенистого переулка — муха, мопед, тарантас, шаги обывателя. Будучи представителем прокуратуры, Пожилых укладывается около десяти. Он читает в постели столичный журнал, не \nчурается стихотворений, поэм и нередко по памяти декламирует то, \nчто запало, запомнилось. В частности — Подъезжая под Ижоры, \nпричем Ижоры воображаются большим деревянным градом на горе, посреди просторной пожухлой пажити. Через поле, оранжевое, \nкак апельсин, под небом погожего, хоть и не слишком теплого полдня, катит дормез с громоздкими рессорами, сработанными из кованого металла. Пассажир, чернявый и бойкий, с небрежно расчесанными кучерявыми баками, высовывается и, слегка придерживая \nрукою цилиндр, предается воспоминаниям: и воспомнил ваши взоры, ваши синие глаза. Ижоры близятся, и золоченые купола так и блещут. В случае убытия за пределы уезда, особенно если в жемчужной \nвлажности тумана мерцающе-светло парит смутность странного обмана, или попросту холодно, надевает непродуваемую душегрейку \nи бурки основательного пошива. Переночевав, велит запрягать, да \nпоживее. Позвякивает, светает. Эх, прокачу по тряской, ямщик с глазами как у кролика, в лисьем тулупе, хищно осклабившись волчьей \nпастью, подмигивает с облучка. И точно, дорога не гудронирована. \nСправа, в полутора, а то и более, верстах — река. За нею — селенье \nсо множеством бань и барок на берегу. Церковь вся отражается. Отражаются и воро́ны, роящиеся вкруг колокольни, как черные, вознесенные зефиром портняжные лоскуты. Село сие, ежели довериться \nплану, имеет прозвание долгое и бестолковое. В имени его чудится \nбухающий ход маховика, оно как бы машет издали квадригою крыл, \nне ведающих иного, высочайшего своего предназначения. Тут услышишь и звуки погрузки; тукая сапогами и крякая на всю середину \nавгуста, несут белесые пятипудовые кули и командуют стоящему на \nподводе: ну, принимай! Тот и вправду кидается. Еще мерещится \nв настоящем названии косноязычие Мельникова подручного, малоума и дылды, который на ваш вопрос — какое это село будет? — нисколько не возражает, но лишь сосет леденец на палочке да знай \nледенит вашу заезжую душу своим подыжорским взором. Для музыкального уха название наше разражается целой симфонией, ведь \nобнаруживается в нем голос и самого мельника, что, услышав приведенную здесь беседу, с готовностью поспешает — если только возможно так отозваться о том, кто едва ходит, будучи обременен избытком здоровья, — спешит на подмогу косноязычному. Но мельник \nсловно бы и сам насовал себе что-то в рот — не иначе каких-нибудь \nжерновов, так как зерна словес его сыплются на путешественника \nмуко́й шума. И что с того, что в тумане нет-нет да забрезжит сокровенное имя: разобраться доподлинно — Мало-ли-то-кулебяково, \nМыло-ли-кулелёмово — недостает проницательности.\n",

  content: "Well, she says, as a rule, I live all the time in the \nbarracks here. We have a cozy park, with swings, \nthe residents are also quite friendly, and there is \na ravine—walk to your heart’s content. Earlier a certain granny, \nthe old ragpicker, shared quarters with me. She smelled of old \nstuff worser than you do, and I was only gettin into prime, my \nhands, fittin my years, smelled of milk, my hair was wavy, curly. \nAnd I wanted to walk; I’ll go out and walk all day. On the glades \nit is pleasant—magpies, rooks. When they fly up—half of the \nsky is gone. And don’t leave nothin shiny—they’ll steal it. \nSometimes I would shout: Shoo from my money! I used to \npick large dandelions, collect clover for food; after all, fate did \nnot spoil me with sweets. And once a trapper captured a fox \ncub, what a joy! And he predicted: When it grows up it’ll be a \nfox. But not long the fox cub stayed with us—it got lost. \nI searched in the woods—there’s no fox, what pity, what sadness. Later we went with Granny to search for wasted coal on \nthe railroad embankment. We have to fire our stove, the fall is \ncomin. The gray slag from locomotives, Orina tells me, as if I \nnever searched for it myself, the gray slag from locomotives \nthey throw out, and in the gray there is black, what didn’t burn \naway; you noticed it—pick it up and that’s it. And we found the \nfox on the rails, sliced up. Apparently some strangers caught it \nand tied it with twine to its doom. Woe is the fox, it perished, \nsharp teeth, very long tail. And Granny: Don’t wail now, this \nain’t ours, ours was smaller; let’s better pull the skin off. No, \nGranny, don’t pretend, it’s ours, it grew up in summer. And the \ntrapper later asks about the fox. But I hid the truth. The trapper \nwas our neybor, but I wasn’t goin out with him. At first, I was \ngoin alone, with nobody. But, after all, age takes its toll and a \nyoung sailor turned my head: Jokin aside, what’s there to fear, \nhe says. What do you think, he finally got what he wanted. At \nthe very beginnin, quietly—he kept touchin, snugglin. His \nmouth was so sweet. I am laughin: What, did you munch some \nfruit drops? And the sailor: I always use them—you know, we \nneed to get rid of the tobacco odor, otherwise our commander \nwill give us hell, we’re not allowed to smoke, we’re underage. \nWhen we return to our craft from a furlow, he arranges inspections: Well, cadets, breathe, he demands, right away. Other fellows buy mints in the boat’s apothecary, but in my opinion \nfruit drops are more useful, although so far my teeth are not \ntoo good, I grew up in evacuation, around Chistopol, so they’re \nall completely rotten, but then from mints a blister bursts just \nlike that on your tongue, and fruit drops you chew your entire \nway back—and no worries. You can also chew tea or coffee \nbeans, only the packaged tea in your pocket will spill out for \nsure and when the commander starts turnin your pockets inside out, he’ll decide it’s tobacco, and you won’t prove that it’s \ntea, and if you do prove it—that’s another minus: After all, tea \ncan also be smoked and it can be turned into a strong brew, so \nwith tea you’ll get burned in both cases, and with coffee too. \nNo, honestly, fruit drops are more reliable than everythin else, \nno snags, and to hell with these cavities, if you think about it, \nthe main thing is, the nerves are worth more. And will you \ngimme some? If you agree, he said, the entire tin is yours. And \nI wasn’t spoiled by sweets. So he led me, obviously, ashore, and \ndragged me under the boat here, but I am still not trustin him \ntoo much. Then he lit a cigarette and is gettin ready to burn the \nskin on my stomach. So what was I to do, I would have not \ndone it with him otherwise. He was puny though, Ilyusha, punier than you. Probably Chistopol was showin, but we haven’t \nslept a wink all the same. We got out when it was already grayish, and when we started I could still see through the entry gap \nhis trainin gunboat in the middle: We are at the roadstead, he \nbragged. The boat looked all dark gray, and the gun—in the \nsack. And it was windy—waves, splatter. At home Granny met \nme and started reamin me out, she splattered the fruit drops all \nover the floor. Well, so after that I haven’t said no to the youngster no more. One day he shows up—he’s wearin a pea jacket: \nYou see, what lousy weather, finito. So you won’t visit after \nthis? No, I’ll drop in when spring comes, he says, why would I \ntraipse over snowdrifts senselessly, and Granny, he hints, will \nnot allow us to do it in the room, and under the dinghy it’s almost unthinkable, packed with snow, so all the very best to you \nuntil later. And a certain man lived then in the neyborin barrack, did handicrafts, had a room under the stairs, and smelled \nof leather and wax. There’s more in store—Granny gives me \nthe fox’s hide: Here, take it over there, perhaps this chap will \nstitch you soft loafers for free. Why not, I can stitch them, he \nsaid, but for free, for mersi, so far, nothin’s done here. When he \nstarted takin measurements of my foot, he locked the door \nright away, put the hook in—and you know what. Drop in for \nfittins, he instructed, and I started comin often to them fittins. \nHe had stitched nice mocs in January; for strength he applied \nthe vamps, for looks he edged them with the fox’s tail—not \nbad. It was comfy to walk in them along the piles of blown \nsnow to visit him, softer than soft. And toward the spring—I’m \nalready in the family way. And you cannot keep the cat in the \nbag forever—right?—so in the barracks they started all kind of \ngossip. Granny lamented: Every hour somethin worse, she \nsaid, our Orina liked to walk and became a streetwalker, just \nwait what will happen next, she kept worryin. And along the \nfresh grass, the sailor boy—ahoy—calls again under the scow; \nhe hauled there a bunch of old junk from the ship. And it so \nhappened that in the mornin I am with the handyman, and at \nsunset I hurry to the river shore. And I got so used to it, so into \nit, that if one or two days go by without the usual—then I’m in \ntrouble, I squirm, languish inwardly, as if a piece of ice was \nburnin inside me. You’re turnin into a pro, the sailor suggested. \nDo you mind if on the weekend I bring a pal with me? And two \nof them arranged their visits, but even together they could not \nkeep up with me. But then, suddenly, they got a big leave from \nthe gunboat—the order was given—and they presented me \nwith four. I started protestin, I won’t manage with all, and I did \nnot like the way the new ones talked; if you listened, they \nseemed awfully crude about everythin. And then they purposely pretended that there will be only two of them at a time, \nlike usual, and their friends will wait close by. But when he and \nhis pal in one pair have finished gratin me, then they whistle on \nthe other two wooers. I understood my predicament—decided \nto get rid of them, but again only threw my words to the wind. \nThat’s how they tricked me and in addition got me all bruised \nup. We’ve got ourselves a swell discharge, one of them esplained later, otherwise you wander like a homeless pup, don’t \nknow where to go; after all, we ain’t locals, acquaintances—\nzilch, and we’ve got to kill time, we’re young, after all. Well, we \ncan drop in to the barber to make ourselves spic-and-span, or \nto the Armenian to get our shoes buffed squeaky-clean, to \nchange the laces, or to the movies, or to the skatin rink in the \nworst case. But the skatin rink ain’t open all year, and the movies they show all year ain’t funny, and if you wanna smoke, \nsmoke in your sleeve or they’ll escort you out. And even at the \nskatin rink you can’t run fast that much, his pal nodded, you \nget a furlow, go to the park, rent them blades, get them sharpened, go here-there, have some mors in the buffet, then sprint \nonce down the main alley—and right away you’re drenched, \nyou can wring your outfit dry, ’cuz it does not befit us to leave \nour pea jackets on the hooks: They’ll damage them, fray them, \ntread on the fleet’s honor. So from that time on they made it \ntheir custom to do it in turns. One of them is in, and the rest \nstay outside. And they noticed some youngster spyin on them \nfrom the bushes. They’ve caught him, dragged him in, they’re \nmockin. I asked: Let me be with him alone. They went out, for \nthem it makes no difference, they started bakin potatoes. At \nfirst my trapper was shy, such a touch-me-not, but when I fondled him more carefully, he got tamed. I dozed off, and when I \nwoke up—he vanished. The sailors came back, offered me potatoes, three axes, and in October I gave birth—before due \ndate. Everythin’s not like with normal people, Granny kept \ncomplainin. And many things happened around. The sailors \nwent missin, the shoemaker also faded away, Granny disappeared somewhere, and my son is gone, but I am still here, I \nlive here permanently, as a rule. The geese in Ilya started rufflin \ntheir feathers, Fomich. ’Cuz, after all, what kind of a sucker, \nflashed thru my mind, I appear to her and to myself, what kind \nof stupid games were we playin, why did we have to drag and \nstretch everythin for months, why did I want to show her my \nrespectability-humility? I thought like that and I thought in \njerks, a water strider. My jerky path thru life tore off by itself, \nlike an old rag. As if my everlastin attire got ripped by dogs, and \npartially it did, indeed. I considered this parable seriously and \nwith the deeply saddened soul realized that this granny, greatgranny, foresaw everythin to the core, not for naught she was a \ncelebrated ragpicker. Yep, Orina, you were known as a walker \nand turned into a typical strumpet. Don’t be cross, I am tired of \nbein prim and proper, so I will force you, teaser, right now, \nhere, on the gunboat junk, not waitin for other occasions. I am \neternally infirm, but I wasn’t always. And I came closer. I will \nhowl about it, as it is written, like the jackals and weep like a \nwolverine. Ilya was so tempted that he became a clown, he got \nderailed on account of a skirt; he turned into a cat in heat; his \nreputation got tarnished. If I only knew where you’re gonna \nplop down, I would spread some straw there and would authoritatively burn with lightnin all the shameful tatters, I would \nturn them to ash on behalf of the celestial powers, even though, \nlately, I haven’t seen any special allocations from that agency at \nall. But, in the end, one’s livin not by manna alone, there will \nalways be enough mussels for us, there will. So I am fryin them \nslowly; it’s almost supper. Dusk’s all around; evenin’s all about; \nItil’s all over. But there, where the Wintry Man drives his \nspouse in the carriage to meet the Grim Reaper, a dry leaf coils \nin flight into a roll-up; around Gorodnishche, where they talk \nabout Yegor—that is, about Fyodor—it’s pure December, and \non our Wolf River, though it’s hard to believe, orioles and \nwoodpeckers. Steamy and hot are the mussels in their Gehenna, they screech; I feel sorry for them. Nevertheless, I swallow, eat one after another, scrapin from mother-of-pearl what’s \nedible. The Wintry Man is also sad to get rid of his wife, but he \ndoesn’t change his mind either. I pity you, he laments, after all, \nI am drivin you to drown you. Well, you don’t have to, she, the \nold rascal, gives him advice, just look back how many years we \nserved together. But that’s exactly it, the Wintry Man complains, so many years that I cannot stand you one day more, \nyou’re dreary. But I’m askin, he continues, put yourself in my \nposition and don’t hold a big grudge against your oaf. No worries, she absolves his sin, to each his own, don’t miss your \nchance, only you too, my friend, don’t judge me too harshly: \nMost likely, I will bother you now and then. Do not, she says, \nwait for me necessarily every night, and yet, now and then I’ll \ndrop in to scare you. The masters about Pyotr: What’s with \nFyodor? And none of them knows nothin properly; they all \nforgot everythin outrite, negligent dummies. Only I, standin \nfor some reason among them in December, kept everythin in \nmemory. And so, the sitters worked the accounter up about \nhangin—no, you ain’t brave, even though you’re Yegory. He \ngot offended at the guzzlers, ’cuz they questioned his darin—\nand shortly afterward left the spit, to prove, in the same blue \nhaze, that he won’t allow such numbers. And he pilfered what \nhe needed where he needed, and hanged without hysterics on \nthe waxed twine wound eight times, havin thrown that renowned baluster across from one pine to the other at a proper \nheight. And the gardians of the hunt find him in such an independent position and summon a medic from Gorodnishche: \nWe request, you understand, your help. He dragged himself in, \nthey showed him—go on, heal. The medic says to them: Personally, I am attestin asfyxiation. And we thought that our \nclime’s givin him fits; well, but as far as bein, will he be? I don’t \npromise what I can’t promise, the quack told them. Medical \nprofession knows better, they say, it turns out he kicked the \nbucket, poor lonely wretch, he croaked. True, that dame sheltered him at the very end, but even that ain’t worth much—\nlike from Friday to Thursday, like a carrot and a stick. It would \nbe amusin to find out who will be next with her now, with \nwhom will she have fun and whom, they kept guessin, she’ll \nmake an orphan. That’s what the wardens of Shallow Reach \nwere guessin at the outskirts of the village Overbrowears, and \nshe has already, one should think, secretly chosen whom exactly. It got clear later, durin the wake after Fyodor, where due \nto the relatively close approach of muscle-buildin winter they \ndid not shun to invite me too. We lugged him to Vygodoshchi, \ndeliberated for a while, and decided to take the wake outside, \nto the area shared by all, to the islands of Tavern Dawn, about \nwhich the departed always spoke with such admiration. There’s \nperhaps no place on the entire Wolf River more fittin than \nthese scraps of land. At the first sight, just an ordinary spot, \ndamp and muddy; well, a birch tree flickers here or there, or a \nmountain ash. But you’ll spend a borin week there, do some \nfishin and lie in the sward with a band of river brigands, lookin \nat billowin clouds and you’ll utter with sobs, quietly-softly: \nLord, how good it is to be here with You. Would you believe \nthe way the water flows—as if it were molasses, flows—as if it \nwere standin; the dome of the firmament unnoticeably sneaks \nthe entire night toward mornin, and the Heavenly Kingdom \nitself is like that: Either it comes—or it doesn’t. But if you look \ncloser—the Itil is rushin, rushin with its entire liquid body. It \nwould be wonderful, word of honor, to give up the ghost on \nthose free patches. I’m dreamin about departin durin the forest \nharvest, sweetenin my lips with a handful of wild strawberries \nand sinkin into the Life Everlastin with them. Really, Lord, I \nam hangin here for no reason, and in general—what did I lose \nhere, what didn’t I see, whom did I come to visit? Or haven’t I \nturned the coarse grindin wheel? No, I don’t need nothin, I \nhaven’t lost nothin, and I belong here like a saddle on a pig. \nWhere are you, time of my death, why do you dillydally in the \ndistance, gimme a sign. But you return to the dry land and \nright away, as a result of all this fussbustle, you forget your reasonin, you suffer and do donkey work unlike Pyotr and them \nother valiant cripples that preferred a reliable rope to drudgery. \nYeah, we ain’t risk-takin, darin creatures; not high, upon verification, is our soarin.\n\nKrylobyl, the dragon-seer, durin the wake stood up at dawn, \ncompletely illuminated by the fire, all covered with grass blades \nand creepy-crawlies, and proclaimed in a loud voice, so the \nsleepers around the other fires, includin the wandrin ones, on \nhis and other islands, would wake up: Reclinin brethren, we are \nnow escortin into nonexistence such a couth of the local hunts, \nas Fyodor, Yegor, Pyotr. We all knew him, that’s why we are \nsad, for that reason we’re ceaselessly drinkin without closin our \neyes. So let’s commemorate the deceased like real people, let’s \nannounce to each other what kind of splendiferous dweller he \nturned out to be. It got noisier than before that Monday around \nthe islands; the invited and uninvited started rememberin the \ngood deeds of the strangled, and began thirstin for another \nround. In the blackout on Tuesday my turn came, and I report \nthat, I won’t hide it, the one responsible for our sad celebrations was a praiseworthy client and that I did grind his racin or \ndamascene blades regularly and sharply, in accord with the bill \nof fare. On Wensday a certain gray-winged mail carrier takes \nthe floor. Fyodor, he admits, was my soul mate, so I always delivered his mail within reasonable deadlines, haven’t opened \nhis letters out of pure curiosity, and if I did open, I sealed them \nback properly. And on Thursday the undertaker found plenty \nto talk about. Our departed, he assures, was an irreplaceable \nupstreamer, but I am also nobody’s fool—I knocked down for \nhim a restin place first-class. Mischief-makers they are, these \nundertakers, dreadful. Here’s an example. Have You ever tried \nto dig in the ground with a shovel in freezin season? It turns out \ntoo mechanical, hard as a rock. So the Bygodoshch folks at first \nwore themselves out, exosted themselves with frozen diggin. \nAnd they got bored by such a waste of time, they stopped diggin in the cold, they dig in summer and fall, for future use. That \nis, they’ll approximate how many folks in the vicinity will depart in season and they make that many pits—they ain’t too \nlazy to add a few just in case, and later they simply need to even \nit up here and there, and it’s done. And considerin that from \nthe middle of the fourth quarter to the middle of the second \nthey charge accordin to the frozen price list, it becomes obvious and enviable—winter will be fantabulous for them. And \nKaluga nicknamed Kostroma happened to turn up among us, \nwith a mug double-chinned and sturdy, so sturdy that there was \nno neck. He did not respect the village hustle, sat on an island, \nin a barrel, all shaggy, and had no special likin for the authorities whatsoever. On Sunday he floats in on a raft to our backwater and states: Pyotr should not have gone with that broad. \nIntrestin, what you’d have done, they argued with the wolfman, \nit’s not you who is choosin her but other way around. Doesn’t \nmatter, he answered, he shouldn’t have gone; if he didn’t, he \nwouldn’t have gone cuckoo ’cuz of her and wouldn’t share the \nbottle with the sitters, and if he didn’t share, he would be celebratin with all of us. Watch out, Krylobyl fortold Kaluga, or the \ncup may come to you. The same day at sunset Kostroma wakes \nup with an odd feelin: Who was beckonin me from the sedge \nright now? Nobody beckoned you right now. No, somebody \nbeckoned, I need to go and see. He dived into the sharp sedge \nand vanished, and when he turned up at the third dawn, they \nsurrounded him and kept askin: Well? He told them: She. Was \nit sweet? Don’t ask. He’s grimacin, as if he was havin a seizure. Watch out, Krylobyl warned him, so it doesn’t get bitter. \nOn Wensday, Kaluga ate belladonna berries; dyin, he warned: \nBe on gard; from childhood I stared at it and was cautious, but \ntoday I saw a bush and put caution aside: The berry is ripe, \nlarge, and so is my misery—we had fun, she told me, and now \nforget it. Therefore, go ahead, touch, these hooves of mine are \nalready like ice. And he became thoughtful. Just look, what bad \nluck, complaints are spreadin all over the islands, the bream in \nthe rivers is on the spawn, tears the nets, and here—either a \nwake or a funeral. I’ll digress. Have You guessed who that dame \nis, Fomich? Once I was snoozin in my nappin shed—I had a \ndream about eggs: Someone will appear, so you better know. \nI woke up and hobbled outside to pray. A turquoise star fell \nfrom the sky, the Volga cooled down, my friends and pals \nthinned out, the fences are all covered in hoarfrost, and I myself am no more than just a name on her tablets. Both laughable and rather short I am, a nitwit. The night is like a debtor’s \njail: Who knows when they’ll drag you out. But You—whoever \nYou are—don’t abandon me. That’s how I prayed. And then \nright away the voice: A certain person will visit your places \nand everythin here will turn topsy-turvy. I went, warned; they \ndon’t believe me. What kind of stuff are you talkin about, what \nelse can turn topsy-turvy here? As you wish. And one day that \nKaraban, a man of non-advanced age, visited our familiar crashbaret. At the threshold he stumbled, and his small transparent \ncontainer in the shape of a flask smashed into smithereens. \n’Nuf guzzlin, he snapped in distress. It became quiet like in the \ndeaf and mutes’ shelter. They brought him a treat. He swigged \nit. I was restin, he relates, under the elms, near the site of the \nbathhouse fire, by the pant-washin deck. The night was like \nany other, only greenish, ’cuz of the star, and the moon was \nlike any other, only ginger. And down the ginger-moon road, \nlike along the decks, from Gybodoshchi to Gorodnishche \nhere, over the river reach, approaches, in no hurry, a puzzlin \nunknown woman. At first I decided—some auntie thought she \nwould take a bath, she forgot that our splashhouse had burned \nlong ago. But then I looked closely and it was none else but \nthe Life Everlastin. She’s lookin kind, modest, she’s wearin no \nclothes whatsoever, but you can sense she knows what she’s \nworth, and she’s gorgeous—to tears. She sat down next to me, \nand we exchanged caresses, not straight on but as if someone \nhad forbidden us—lightly as a feather. We fooled around for \na while—and she went away, the speak-of-the-devil. All in all, \nit’s clear—she visited us, she did, concluded Karaban. We had \na swig then, and a chaser. We’re not guzzlin, he says, but takin \nmedicine, and not just any which way, but like pristipomas.\n",

  content: "Мол, все время я в бараках тут проживаю вообще. Парк приютный у нас, с качелями, жильцы тоже вполне приветливые, и овраг \nимеется свой — гуляй не хочу. Прежде эта бабуля жировку со мной \nделила, старьевщица. Старым веяла пуще тебя, а я только в сока́\nвходила, мне руки мои по летам молоком самой пахли, волос вился, \nкурчавился. И гулять я хотела, уйду и гуляю весь день. На опушках \nпривольно — сороки, грачики. Как взовьются — полнеба нет. А блестящего ничего не оставь — уворуют. Чур мои деньги, бывало, кричу. Одуваны рвала большие, кашку-клевер собирала поесть, меня \nже сладким судьба не баловала. А однажды лисенка ловец поймал, \nто-то радости. И предсказывал: вырастет — станет лис. Но немного \nпобыл лисенок у нас — пропал. Я искала в лесах — нету лиса, обидно, горестно. После отправились мы с бабулей уголь бросовый на \nнасыпи поискать. Печку ж надо топить, дело к осени. Серый шлак \nс паровозов, Орина мне говорит, будто я сам никогда не искал, серый шлак с паровозов сбрасывают, а в сером — черное, непрогорелое, \nприметил — бери, и все. И мы лиса нашли на путях разрезанного. \nВидно, люди какие-нибудь посторонние изловили и привязали на \nгибель бечевками. Горе лису, пропал, зубы острые, хвост предлинный. А бабуля: да не реви, вот, не наш это, наш меньше́е, давай лучше шкурку спяливать. Нет, бабуля, ты не сбивай, это наш, вырос за \nлето. И ловец про лиса спрашивает потом. Но сокрыла я истину. \nБыл ловец мой соседом нашим, но с ним не гуляла. Я сначала одна \nгуляла, ни с кем. Но ведь возраст берет же свое, и матросик увлек: \nкроме шуток, что страшного-то, говорит. Что ж ты думаешь, настоял-таки на его. Попервоначалу тишком — трогал, ластился. Рот \nу него сладющий такой. Я смеюсь: что ли, вы монпансье себе кушали? \nА моряк: я всегда применяю, знаешь ли, табака необходимо запах \nотбить, иначе командир заругается, нам курить же нельзя, мы невзрослые. Мы когда в экипаж из увольнения возвращаемся, он проверки заделывает — дыхните-ка, требует, юнги, скоренько. Ребята \nсен-сен в судовой аптеке берут, а по мне — монпансье полезнее, хоть \nи зубы пока не того, я ж в эвакуации рос, под Чистополем, все \nсплошь порченые, но зато от сен-сена типун выскакивает запросто \nна языке, а монпансье всю дорогу грызешь — хоть бы хны. Чаем тоже зажевывать можно, кофейными зернами, только чай в кармане \nпросыплется пачечный как пить дать, и командир карманы как пойдет выворачивать нам — решит, что табак, и не докажешь, что чай, \nно и докажешь — тебе же минус: чай же тоже можно курить и чифирять тоже можно, так что с чаем так и так погоришь, да и с кофеем. \nНет, по-честному, монпансье надежней всего, никакого шухера, и леший с этими дуплами, если так разобраться, главное, нервы дороже. \nА меня угостите? Согласишься, сказал, вся жестянка в твою пользу \nпойдет. А я ж сладким не забалованная. И увел, конечно, на берег, \nпод бот сюда умыкнул, но я все одно не доверяю особенно. Папироску тогда раскурил и кожу на животе у меня прижигать собирается. \nКуда же я денусь, но так ни за что бы не стала с ним. Даром что \nщуплый он был, тебя-де, Илюша, щуплей, Чистополь, вероятно, давал себя знать, однако мы и чуть-чуть не выспались. Вылезли, а высерело уже, а началось — еще канонёрку его учебную на середине видела через лаз: на рейде, хвастал, стоим. Смурая вся из себя, \nа пушка в мешке. И ветрено было, волнисто, хлябь. Дома бабуля \nвстречает и ну шерстить, и монпансье все по полу раздрызгала. Что \nже, затем не отказывала уже пареньку. Как-то заглядывает — на нем \nбушлат: чуешь, как закрутило, кранты. Что ли не навестите впоследствии? Нет, весной заскочу, говорит, а по сугробам чего топотать-то без толку, бабуля же, намекает, нам не потрафит, чтоб в комнате мы, а под шлюпкой почти немыслимо, намело, вот и всякого \nтебе до поры наилучшего. И мужчина некоторый в соседнем бараке \nтогда проживал, кустарничал, под лестницей помещенье держал, кожей пахнул да ваксами. Дальше — больше, бабуля шкуру лиса дает: \nна, снеси, может, дядька этот тапти мягкие стачает тебе за так. Отчего не стачать, он сказал, но за так, за мерси, не делается у нас покудова ничего. Как стал размер с ноги у меня снимать, так сразу дверь \nзакрыл, крюк навесил — и на тебе. Забегай на примерку, он назначал, и я на примерки пошла частить. Тапти ладные стачал в январе \nмесяце; ради крепости обсоюзил, для форсу хвостом оторочил — худо ли? Ловко получалось в них вдоль свеев к нему самому гулять, \nмягче мягкого. А к весне уже в положении. И ведь шила в мешке не \nутаишь небось, и вот сплетни разные по баракам понавыдумывали. \nБабуля расстроилась: час от часу не легче, мол, была у нас Оря гулена, а стала гулящая, то ли будет еще, все нервничала. А по новой \nтраве — моряк с печки бряк, опять под баркас зовет, ветоши корабельной полно туда натаскал. И бывало, утрами я с кустарем, а зорями на лукомор спешу. И уже так притерлась, владилась, что как \nдень-другой без обычного — так беда, изовьюсь вся, изноюсь внутренне, ну словно лед у меня там горит. Ты скаженная делаешься, \nматрос предложил, не возражаешь, если я кореша в выходной прихвачу. И они вдвоем повадились навещать, только и совместно не \nуспевали за мной. Как вдруг у них отгулы большие на канонерке — \nкоманда дана, и они четверых мне представили. Запротивилась, со \nвсеми-то не в расчет, да и речи их, новеньких, не понравились, больно просто у них, как послушаешь, получалось в отношеньи всего. \nИ тогда понарошке прикинулись, что будут только вдвоем, по-обычному, а дружки невдалеке погодят. Но когда на пару с приятелем \nразбередили меня, то и тем ухажерам они свистят. Поняла положение — задумала отвертеться от них, но слова лишь на ветер растратила. Вот ведь как обмишурили, да синяков еще насажали. Ничего \nмы уволились, один разъяснял потом, а то бродишь как цуцик, заскочить не знаешь к кому, мы ж не местные, знакомых нема, но время же надо убить, мы ж мо́лодежь. Ну там в перукарню марафет \nнавести забежишь, ну к армяшке штиблет подраить, шнурок сменить, ну в кино, на каток, на худой конец. Но каток ведь не круглый \nгод, а кино круглый год не смешное кажут, а желаешь дымить, то \nдыми в рукав, а то выведут. Да и на катке особо не разбежишься, \nприятель поддакивал, уволишься, поедешь ты в эти парки, ножики \nвозьмешь напрокат, в точку сунешь, туда-сюда, морсу выпьешь \nв буфете, потом пропилишь по главной аллее разок — сразу мокрый, хоть робу всю выжимай, нам бушлаты ж на вешалку сдавать \nне к лицу: попортят еще, потибрят, заденут флотскую честь. С этих \nпор за обычай взяли по очереди. Кто-то тут, а остальные снаружи \nнаходятся. И заметили, что пацан подглядывает из кустов. Изловили его, втащили, насмешничают. Попросила — а дайте я с ним одна. \nОтошли, им без разницы, картошки начали печь. Поначалу чурался \nловец мой, такой недотрога был, но приласкала дотошней — освоился. Задремала, очнулась — а он пропал. Моряки возвратились — \nкартошек дали, портвейного, а в октябре родила я — не в срок. Все \nне как у людей, бабуля расстраивалась. И много чего случилось кругом. То матросы тоже пропали, то сапожник слинял, и бабуля кудато девалась, и сын мой канул, а я все здесь; постоянно тут проживаю, \nкак правило. Встрепенулись гуси в Илье, Фомич. Ведь каким же \nрастютей, пронзило, себе же и ей предстаю, что за игры глупеющие \nтворились, к чему это резину дешевую пришлось месяцами тянуть, \nчто ли, выказать я желал уважение-унижение. Вроде этого мыслил, \nа мыслил рывками я, водомер. Рваный ход мой по веку и сам оборвался, дрянь. Будто псами трачены обновы мои вековечные, да \nчастично и псами. Я к фацеции этой приник со рвением и в тошноте души осознал, что бабуля та, прабабуля, сквозь землю провидела, \nстарьевщицей трубила не зря. Да, слыла ты, Орина, гуленой, а сделалась шлендра типичная. Не взыщи, подустал я жантильничать \nи понужу тебя, ломаку, прямо нынче же, тут, на канонерском тряпье, \nне дожидаясь иных оказий. Вечно я немочь буду, но был не всегда. \nИ придвинулся. Об этом, пишется, буду выть, как шакалы, и росомахой рыдать. Соблазнился Илья к шутам и пошел через бабу вразнос, повело его, как того кота, подмочило ему репутацию. Знать бы, \nгде шмякнешься, там соломки бы подстелил и всю позорную ветошь молнией бы полномочно пожег, испепелил бы от имени светлых сил, пусть пайков специальных сухих от конторы от этой не \nвижу в последние сроки ничуть. Да ведь не манной единой, ракушек еще на наши века достанет, ракушек-то. Вот пеку не спеша, дело к ужину. Всюду сумерки, повсюду вечер, везде Итиль. Но там, \nгде Зимарь-Человек на телеге супругу на карачун повез, лист сухой \nв самокрутку сворачивается на лету; под Городнищем, где речь про \nЕгора, про Федора, — чистый декабрь; а на нашей на Волчьей — не \nверится даже — там иволга, там желна. Парко, жарко ракушкам в геенне их, эк скрипят, соболезную. Все ж одну за другой глотаю и ем, \nотскребая от перламутров съедобное. Скорбно и Зимарь-Человеку \nжену губить, но и он от решенья не отступается. Жаль тебя, он ей \nплачется, топить ведь везу. А не вез бы, она ему, шельма ветхая, совет подает, сколь годов, оглянись, вместе отбыто. Да вот тот-то и оно, \nЗимарь сетует, столь годов, что терпеть тебя ни дня более не могу, \nопостынула. Но прошу, продолжает, в положенье мое войди и зла \nна олуха не держи особенно. Что уж там, она ему отпускает грех, \nвольному воля, охулки на руки не клади, только и ты, дружочек, не \nобессудь: вероятно, обеспокою порой. Не обязательно, говорит, еженощно жди, ну а все-таки нет-нет да и загляну постращать. Мастера \nпро Петра: что с Федором? И никто ничего не знает как следует, все \nс концами забыли, фефелы халатные. Один я почему-то, средь них \nв декабре стоящий, все в памяти удержал. Заводили, стало быть, \nсчетовода сидни насчет повеситься — де, не храбрый ты, хоть и Егорий. Разобиделся он на бражников, удаль его, видите ли, поставили \nпод вопрос, — и вскорости косу покинул, дабы в эту же синеву доказать, что с ним подобные номера не проходят. И спроворил что \nнадо где следовало, и завис без истерик на дратве вощеной и скрученной в восемь раз, знаменитую ту балясину перебросив с сосны \nна другую на правильной высоте. И находят его сторожа охот в независимом таком положении и выписывают того ли фельдшера из \nГороднищ: окажи, понимаешь, помощь. Притащился, ему показали — врачуй. Фельдшер им: лично я свидетельствую удушие. А мы \nдумали, просто не климатит ему тут, ну а быть, быть-то будет? Чего \nне обещаю — того не обещаю, им лекарь сказал. Медицине видней, \nговорят, отзвенел, получается, горемыкалка одинокий, откуковал. \nПриласкала, правда, дама его эта под самый конец, но и то рябам на \nсмех — с пятницы на четверг, салом словно бы по сусалам. С кем, \nзабавно бы выяснить, со следующим она побудет теперь, кого осчастливит, а кого, гадали, осиротит. Так гадали мелкоплесовские сторожа в районе села Вышелбауши, а она уже, надо думать, наметила \nтайно, кто именно. Выяснилось потом, в теченье поминок по Федору, куда в сравнительно недалеких видах физкультурной зимы не \nпогнушались зазвать и меня. Оттаранили его мы на Выгодощи, посовещались и тризну постановили вынести на общий простор, на \nКабацкой Зари острова, о которых с таким почтением отзывался \nвсегда отчаливший. Нет, может быть, местечка на целой Волчьей \nгодящее, нежели те земляные клочки. С первого взгляда — гряда \nкак гряда: мочажина, болотина, ну березка мелькнет, ну рябина. Но \nпроскучаешь с неделю там, порыбалишь да поваляешься с ватагой \nушкуйников в мураве, на облака тучевые дивясь, и промолвишь навзрыд тихохонько: Господи, хорошо нам здесь быть с Тобой. Веришь \nли, как вода мимо нас идет — как пишет, идет — как стоит; купол \nнебесный так неприметно крадется всю ночь к утру, и Царствие само Небесное так: грядет не грядет. А присмотришься резче — летит, \nлетит всей плотью плавной Итиль. Чудно бы, честное слово, окочуриться на этих привольных клочках. Отойти мечтается в пору ягод, \nчтоб пригоршней земляники уста себе усладить и в Жизнь Вечную \nс тем и кануть. Право, Господи, не лишнего ли звеню, и вообще — \nчто забыл тут, чего не видел, к кому пришел? Или точила шершавого не вертел? Нет, не надо мне ничего, ничего не забыл я тут, и любому дяде троюродный я плетень. Где ты, смертная година, чего \nзамешкалась в отдаленье, подай мне знак. Но вернешься на материк \nи ра зом за суетохой забудешь резоны свои, снова терпишь и лямку \nтянешь, в отличие от Петра и других удалых калек, что лямке веревку надежную предпочли. Да, не рисковая, не лихая мы косточка, \nне высокого мы, на поверку, парения.\n\nКрылобылка, змей вещий, на поминках под утро как-то восстал, \nвесь от костра светозарный, весь в травинках и мурашах, и объявил \nв полный голос, чтобы у прочих огней, в том числе и блудящих, на \nего и на остальных островах, спящие пробудились: братия возлежащая, ныне провожаем в пакинебытие такого вежду окрестных охот, \nкак Федора, Егора, Петра. Его мы все знали, затем-то нам и печально, поэтому и беспробудничаем столь бессонно. Помянем же усопшего по-человечески, возвестим каждый всякому, какой он здо́ровский жителин оказался. Зашумело в тот понедельник по островам \nгуще прежнего, стали званые и незваные удавленника добром поминать и алкать завелись по следующей. При затменьи во вторник \nнастал мой черед, и докладываю, что, не скрою, виновник наших невеселых торжеств клиент был достойный и что ножи ему беговые \nбулатные я точил регулярно и остро, со ссылкой на прейскурант. \nВ среду почтарь один сизокрылый слово берет. В Федоре, признается, души я не чаял, почту всегда доставлял ему в разумные сроки, \nписем его из чистого любопытства не распечатывал, но если и распечатывал, то запечатывал заподлицо. А в четверг погребальщик \nразговорился. Незаменимый, уверяет, покойник наш был верховет, \nно и я же не промах — покои ему сварганил на ять. Прокураты они, \nпогребальщики, невозможные. Дам пример. Пробовали вы в морозные поры лопатой землю долбать? Слишком уж механически получается, невпротык. Наломались, намаялись и быгодощенские на \nкопке сперва ледяной. И приелась им таковская канитель, прекратили по холоду ковырять, летом и осенью роют, впрок. То есть прикинут примерно, сколько на круг по окрестности публики за сезон \nотойдет, — столько ямин и сделают, даже гака не ленятся прихватить, \nа в дальнейшем лишь подровнять там да сям и надзор. И учитывая, \nчто с середины четвертого квартала до середины второго платы взимают по мерзлому ценнику, то становится очевидно и завидно — зима задается у них непыльная. А затесался меж нами Калуга по прозвищу Кострома, харей мордатый и матеро́й, до того матерой — что \nаж шеи нет. Суету деревенскую не уважал, сидел на острове, в бочке, оброс и властей недолюбливал ни в какую. В воскресенье приплыл на плоту в нашу заводь и замечает: нечего было Петру с этой \nбабой идти. Интересно, куда ты денешься, волчатнику возразили, \nне ты же ее выбираешь — наоборот. Все одно, отвечал, нечего было \nему идти, не сходил бы — не сбрендил бы из-за нее и с сиднями бы \nв чекушку не лез, а не лез бы — со всеми нами бы нынче гулял. Берегись, Крылобыл Калуге предрек, как бы чаша и до тебя не дошла. \nВ тот же день при закате солнца просыпается Кострома не в себе: \nкто это меня из осоки сейчас поманил? Да никто тебя не манил. Нет, \nманили, пойти поглядеть. Он в осоку юркнул точеную и пропал, \nа когда обернулся на третьей заре, обступили, расспрашивали: ну? \nОн сказал им: она. Сладко было? Не спрашивайте. Сам лыбится, \nкак в родимчике. Берегись, Крылобыл остерег, как бы горько не сделалось. В среду ягоды волчьей Калуга поел; умирая, наказывал: \nбудьте бдительны; сыздетства на нее я зарился, но терпел, а сегодня \nувидел куст — и не вытерпел, крушина спелая, крупная, да и кручина моя велика — побаловались, она велела, и позабудь. И се, пощупайте, копыта уж — лед. И задумался. Ты гляди, не фартит как, сетование распространилось по островам, самый лещ по ручьям на \nнерест пошел, сети рвет, а у нас — то поминки, то похороны. Отвлекусь я. Догадываетесь, кто дама эта, Фомич? Раз дремал в катухе \nя дремном — приснились яйца. Кто-то явится, так и знай. Пробудился и выхромал помолиться на двор. Пала звезда бирюзовая, остыла \nВолга, поредели други мои и друзья, и заборы все в инее, и сам я не \nболее нежели имя на скрижалях Ее. И смешливый, и невелик аз \nесмь, неразумный. Ночь — как ямина долговая: когда еще вытащат. \nНо Ты — кто бы ни был, Ты — не покинь. Так молился. И тут голос \nмне сразу же: посетит особа некая ваши места и пойдет через пеньколоду все здесь. Я потек, упредил; сомневаются. Что такое рассказываешь нам, что еще через пень-колоду может у нас пойти. Как \nжелаете. И препожалует раз в знакомое вам кубарэ непреклонных \nлет человек Карабан. На пороге споткнулся, и сосуд небольшой \nпрозрачный в виде чекушки — вдрябезги. Будет вам бражничать, \nв треволнении отрубил. Тихо образовалось, как у глухонемых. Преподнесли ему. Выкушал. Отдыхал я, повествует, под ильмами, возле \nбанного пепелища, у портомойных мостков. Ночь как ночь, только \nв зелень ударяет из-за звезды, и луна как луна, только рыжая. И по \nрыжей дороге лунной, как по мосткам, от Гыбодощи сюда, к Городнищу, близится плесом не торопясь непонятная незнакомая. Поначалу решил — тетка некая помыться надумала, забыла, что сгорело \nпорхалище наше давно. Как вдруг пригляделся, а это Вечная Жизнь \nуже. Смотрит ласково, скромно, одежд на себе никаких не имеет, \nно чувствуется, что своего не упустит, а раскрасива — до слез. Села \nрядом, и мы с ней нежничали, но не прямо-таки, а будто бы заказал \nнам кто — полегонечку. Побаловались — пошла себе, легка на помине. В общем, ясно, посетила она, посетила, Карабан заключил. Приняли мы тогда, зажевали. Не хлещем, говорит, но лечимся, и не какнибудь, а как простипомы.\n",

  content: "Note XIX\n\nPortrait of a Familiar Warden\n\n\n  March is crunchy and crispy,\n  Icicles clink and clank,\n  Melting spots seem to whisper\n  \n    And their breath makes you drunk.\n  \n  Into dusky gray haven\n  By the hoarfrost enhanced,\n  You step out, still unshaven,\n  \n    In your jacket and pants.\n  \n  You have boots that are loose,\n  But that isn’t the point,\n  One can make simple shoes\n  \n    From them and put them on.\n  \n  It’s not hard altogether,\n  And it’s easy to prove:\n  One just needs the spare leather\n  \n    Cut from boots and remove.\n  \n  You’re a rambler-rag hoarder,\n  You are lame, but all right,\n  Your strange land’s on the border\n  \n    Just between day and night.\n  \n  A yoke walks by the fence,\n  And a lone bucket swings.\n  Even this makes more sense\n  \n    Than do all other things.\n  \n  You’re a passionate trickster,\n  Though your pranks are age-old,\n  But don’t cry, there’s a fixter\n  \n    Of all snags in the world.\n  \n  You’re a warden, a guardian,\n  With five fingers per hand:\n  Snow is marked in the garden,\n  \n    There are prints in the sand.\n  \n  Like in old fairy stories,\n  Among mighty pine trees\n  Curly and without worries\n  \n    You live almost for free.\n  \n  Your whole life’s but a puff,\n  Or a brief wound-up breeze,\n  And your lonesome babe’s laugh\n  \n    Who’s so willing to please.\n  \n  You live in warden’s hovel;\n  There’s an oil lamp, a pail,\n  An accordion, a shovel,\n  \n    And a gun on a nail.\n  \n  On the newspapers’ stack\n  A bold headline is found:\n  Sterlets in Sterlitamak\n  \n    And tomato—abound.\n  \n  You’re a roisterer seasoned,\n  If you drink—then a shtof.\n  And for that single reason\n  \n    Your own dog you call Wolf.\n  \n  To the dear riverbank\n  Run on your tippy-toes.\n  You are full, you are drunk,\n  \n    And snuff covers your nose.\n  \n  You are tripping and falling\n  And, like a frolicking crew,\n  Down the slope you are rolling.\n  Oh my dear, look at you!\n\n\nNote XX\n\nA Ballad about the Fire Chief from Gorodnishche\n\n\n  Again in your dreams you onions desire,\n  The slush and the splatter make winter roads glum,\n  As soon as the drizzle digests all this mire\n  To do fire drills the interns will come.\n  They’ll come frantic, in coats opened wide,\n  Gregarious, in zits and blackheads,\n  In light jackets, in two-wheeled bouncy rides,\n  Lean and pale—like the sheets on their beds.\n  The expert in the ways snipes escape,\n  Shiny helmet and cartridge belts sporting,\n  Will not shoot wood grouse while it’s courting,\n  But will whip the loudmouths in shape.\n  Fire chief—an individuum in years,\n  Whom asthma and blisters made sour,\n  In April, when the stars are so clear,\n  Will slowly ascend his watchtower.\n  The intern on guard tells the story,\n  Saluting the helmet, yet chary,\n  Of fires that burn in Izhory,\n  But cunningly meaning Stozhary.\n  The chief will salute back: But not here.\n  And he’ll look toward the estuary,\n  Where he wasted so many years,\n  At the fire-watch gruel preparing.\n  He will look—and his calm will decline,\n  So at dawn, angry and bellicose,\n  At the firewall, all the interns in line\n  Fire chief drenches from fire hose.\n\n\nNote XXI\n\nOverbrowears\n\n(A Garland of Notes)\n\n\n  1\n  Unsettling moments. Period of disgrace.\n  Pranks set the brows and the ears on fire.\n  “Can there be Overbrowears?” they inquired.\n  \n    I responded: “It’s a farm, a tiny place.”\n  \n  2\n  Does it behoove to tease and make a face?\n  To mock all things like spoiled brats, spreading sorrow,\n  Show no respect for yesterdays, tomorrows,\n  \n    Forgetting conscience, honor, even grace?\n  \n  3\n  Just look at me—what a trusting fool!\n  I failed to figure, though I am quite clever,\n  That over brow ears can’t happen, ever,\n  \n    While Overbrowears farm can, as a rule.\n  \n  4\n  My ears are red—I’m no longer cool.\n  Unpleasant rumors circulate all over\n  That I’m a creep, a binger, a pushover,\n  \n    A cabbagehead with two ears to pull.\n  \n  5\n  Unsettling moments, period of disgrace.\n  Does it behoove to tease and make a face?\n  Just look at me—what a trusting fool!\n  My ears are red—I’m no longer cool.\n\n\nNote XXII\n\nFarewell of the Tinker from Gorodnishche\n\n\n  Sludge ice is gone. And at the harbor\n  The cashier clicked his register’s keys.\n  Look at your circumstances much harder;\n  Hang your felts on the mantelpiece.\n  Limping and as if by accident vernal\n  Spring has wandered to our Valday.\n  Say—farewell, our dear taverna,\n  Take a hike, beat it, goodbye!\n  They sent a she-goat nut-picking\n  And a he-goat in the garden they let—\n  To fix teapots broken or leaking\n  Beyond rivers the tinkers are set.\n  So forgive us, dear joint, that we’re parting,\n  When it snows, we’ll be back, right behind.\n  You are always so kind and inviting,\n  A shelter for the mute and the blind.\n  Beyond rivers, the tin is much brighter,\n  There the borscht is thicker, and reeds.\n  In the leas with that windbag too flighty\n  You will deal—and you’ll patch in the leas.\n  Beyond rivers, life seems to be freer,\n  And yet, rather than praise Tula tin,\n  With the cripples and revelers here\n  This whole summer I should have stayed in.\n  Fare-thee-well, Gorodnishche, my brothers,\n  As they say, flap your wing for goodbye,\n  ’Cause who knows when again with each other\n  We will sit at this table—you and I?\n  So don’t fuss with my clothes’ rips and holes,\n  Since my cane can’t wait to go forth.\n  But, old woman, now pour me a whole\n  Hunderd-fifty grams of sweet port.\n  There’s a schedule at our harbor,\n  And on the steamboat—a café.\n  There, Graf-like conceited and hardened,\n  Stands the barkeep in his galife.\n\n\nNote XXIII\n\nPortrait of the Ferryman\n\n\n  Sing, ferry driver,\n  Chatty and wacky,\n  Carrot-top jack.\n  Crafty conniver,\n  Sing of craft’s cracking\n  \n    And caulk the cracks.\n  \n  Sing of boat’s gears,\n  Rowlocks’ responses,\n  And anchor’s roll.\n  And of the years’\n  Entire nonsense,\n  \n    Eh, darn them all.\n  \n  I so adore it,\n  When, like a pixie,\n  Lively and spry,\n  Seeking no glory,\n  You’re deftly fixing\n  \n    What’s lying by.\n  \n  Your hammer’s knocking\n  And outside calling\n  In April light.\n  Instead of talking,\n  Let us go strolling\n  \n    Before the night.\n  \n  It smells of mastic,\n  Foot-bindings, candles,\n  All over, but\n  Having no practice,\n  Miss Spring resembles\n  \n    A splendid slut.\n  \n  When on the morrow\n  Afar you see me—\n  Telescope eyes—\n  Forget your sorrows\n  And, widely beaming,\n  \n    Get some supplies.\n  \n  Don’t skimp, you gap-tooth,\n  But open wide\n  Your smorgasbord.\n  And I’ll be apt to\n  Some food provide—\n  \n    Five kopecks worth.\n  \n  Waters are splashing,\n  Flow by themselves\n  To reach their goal;\n  The years are passing,\n  And we ourselves\n  Just live, that’s all.\n\n\nNote XXIV\n\nBetween the Dog\n\n\n  Once, between the dog and wolf,\n  By willows that weep,\n  A warden let his needle drop—\n  Did not stitch the rip.\n  He searched in the grassy pall\n  Each spot he could see,\n  And he found some kind of ball\n  In this verdant lea.\n  And he calls: My brothers, hey,\n  Just look what I found!\n  They came by, began to play,\n  And had lots of fun.\n  They would kick the ball around\n  Or play toss and catch,\n  ’Til the evening dew set down\n  Right on the green patch.\n  And the thick fogs would alight\n  Crawling out from swamps,\n  In their huts folks would ignite\n  The wicks of their lamps.\n  And the fogs from Volga’s swamps\n  Licked the keels and poked,\n  There was little oil in lamps\n  So the wicks just smoked.\n  And the tugboats floated by\n  Heavy barges towing,\n  While the hoopoes in the sky\n  Wooed oxpeckers, cawing.\n  Tugboats floated by the bogs\n  Without or with barges\n  And who knows if wolves or dogs\n  Into woods were charging.\n  Unexpectedly the ball\n  Lit up bright, not far.\n  They looked closely—it was all\n  Stozhary’s main star.\n  On this foggy star, forsooth,\n  With their eyes aglow,\n  Lots of plain, unvarnished truth\n  All the wardens know.\n  There, the wispy fogs alight,\n  Crawling out from swamps,\n  People in their huts ignite\n  The wicks of their lamps.\n  There, between the dog and wolf\n  By willows that weep,\n  A warden let his needle drop—\n  Did not stitch the rip.\n\n\nNote XXV\n\nPortrait of a Courier\n\n(The Second Recollection of the City)\n\n\n  What does “a courier” mean? Consider\n  That to ensure success for strangers\n  And in this world to make some changes\n  One goofball pedals hither-thither.\n  \n    It’s like a calling, someone said.\n  \n  He’s single. With his clueless head\n  Snapping the branches of bird cherry,\n  Addressing to it many queries—\n  Like what’s “a courier,” why, and when?—\n  Forgetting he should darn his stockings,\n  And also constantly chain-smoking,\n  His bike completely overworking,\n  \n    He flickers like a wound-up man.\n  \n  He’s poor and foolish, and high-strung.\n  Nanny, why can’t I sleep tonight?\n  If old—he makes himself look young\n  And if he’s young—he’ll soon be old.\n  He’s feverish and he has a cold\n  With inflammation. But chin up:\n  I’ll shave! Oh, nanny, where’s my brush?\n  How come? It’s very late, don’t rush!\n  Silence, slop-slinger, in my nap\n  I saw a firebird in flight—\n  \n    It said we’ll marry in a snap.\n  \n  And though he fears he’ll get cut up,\n  \n    He hones his blade in lunar light.\n  \n  Crossing the country left and right,\n  Its center and provincial places,\n  He’s stunned by how the world is turning\n  And like a boiling cauldron churning,\n  Revealing both events and faces\n  Cooler than movies new or old:\n  Here’s lion hunting, here—a ball,\n  There—a half-naked lass in laces,\n  And—for your pleasure—even more:\n  A centipede on cellar’s floor.\n  And from the window mother screams:\n  \n    For winter seal the window seams!\n  \n  Now winter’s gone—spring will grow twigs;\n  The courier is the mud decrying,\n  With which the messy street keeps trying\n  To splash his buttocks and is using\n  To this end spokes of quite amusing\n  And fashionable britskas, gigs,\n  \n    Landaus, and other kinds of rigs.\n  \n  And like a decoy mallard duck\n  In rifle sight condemned to quack\n  And with a line for drying clothes\n  Tied to the hunter, lest it’s lost,\n  The courier cannot ever see\n  How very different he could be\n  If he were not worn out by riding\n  More than the decoy by its gliding,\n  If he were born beneath a star\n  Unlike the courier’s, shining far,\n  \n    And duck—beyond its decoy star.\n  \n  (NB: A river, when the dusk has set,\n  When it’s too late for bilboquet,\n  When samovars are finally ready\n  And on verandas chatter’s steady,\n  When, having bid his knitting bye,\n  Grandpa The Catcher in the Rye\n  Reads out to Grandma; also when\n  She seemed to be in doubt,\n  But held cheese in her mouth;\n  When knocks of flint stones got quite loud\n  And let us add another when—\n  When wires disappeared—just then\n  We see the stars in waters deep:\n  But they’re all decoys, there they sleep,\n  And to be with them, from the skies\n  Others fall down and please the eyes:\n  \n    So make a wish, don’t hesitate.)\n  \n  But no such luck. It seems that fate\n  Sets all decisions right in stone.\n  From a department in some state\n  I brought this mail, for you alone.\n  Say, will this junk be never gone?\n  I’m sorry, ma’am, but I don’t know,\n  \n    Therefore, sign on the line below.\n  \n  And so the courier rides once more,\n  He turns or goes straight as before.\n  Please tell me who you are, my dear?\n  Well, old man, I am not from here.\n  A dog will bark at him, and follow,\n  The boob will look around and swallow,\n  Swallow and look, and gulp some air,\n  And take a catnap, one could swear,\n  And then he’ll spit, and with his shoe\n  Rub in the spittle,\n  And afterward, out of the blue,\n  \n    He’ll sob a little.\n  \n  The time will come—all things will pass:\n  People are happy. The mead drips\n  Upon a dickey from the glass,\n  Not reaching the bissextile lips,\n  While Hoopoe begs outside the joint\n  For loose change to buy booze,\n  And inside someone yells, annoyed:\n  \n    You want a swig?—You lose!\n  \n  Now nightingale begins to mill,\n  \n    Now windmill starts to trill!\n  \n  Crossing the land both bright and dreary,\n  The land unquenched and mostly arid,\n  And with his head washed only rarely\n  Snapping the branches of bird cherry,\n  Addressing to it many queries,\n  The courier speeds and rushes, weary,\n  And toward morning, home, on board,\n  He moans and groans: Oh, my dear Lord,\n  That’s what it means . . .\n\n\nNote XXVI\n\nPostal Chores in the Month of May\n\n\n  Why doesn’t he write to me, my most esteemed oncle,\n  Is it possible he does not have time again whatsoever?\n  It’s strange—because he promised: I will write to you unfailingly.\n  Well, look, he doesn’t write and doesn’t come back, absolutely.\n  5  Gazing beyond the river, I gazed-out my eyes completely,\n  He could have sent me at least a pictogram, my dear relative,\n  He could have said, it’s so-and-so, such-and-such plans I consider,\n  ’Cause otherwise, where to run—I couldn’t even imagine,\n  With such an uncle topsy-turvy things constantly happen.\n  10  Washing my feet with the dew as I’m walking,\n  I will set out at dawn to welcome our mail carrier:\n  Are you bringing me at this time a package, as we usually call it?\n  No, he disappoints, apparently, he disappoints, they’re still writing,\n  Apparently, your addressees are careful and thoughtful.\n  15  Fine, we will stand there, shoot the breeze for a few moments,\n  Afterward I will invite him to my humble dwelling:\n  Eh, drop in for a while, my dear friend Sila Silych,\n  You’ll be my guest, you know, we’ll converse a little,\n  Did I brew the nectar yesterday for no reason?\n  20  For no reason, my dear Nestor, nobody here brews nectars,\n  For no reason, in the world practically nothing can happen,\n  For no reason, even a curly hare won’t appear in night ravings.\n  We will, of course, partake of your nectar without postponement.\n  So the dearest postman Sila Silych comes in, so he enters,\n  25  Such a shorty, extremely unimpressive to look at,\n  Although he could drink under the table even Krylobyl in person;\n  That means: Trust the appearances, but always keep double-checking.\n  Yep, so he dropped in to visit me, Sila Silych,\n  Uh, he dropped in, and, having taken his hat off, wiped his lips with it,\n  30  Well, right away I poured for the messenger and for myself also:\n  Let us drink, good folks, let us drink, fellow villagers,\n  Let us drink, since today we’re alive, and who knows what will happen tomorrow.\n  Who knows, who knows, he nods, nothing here is clear,\n  Now you find it and now in an instant you lose it,\n  35  Not to mention that when you allow yourself to kick the bucket,\n  Then, whether you write or not—everything into dust is turning,\n  There your postscriptums are as useless as a dead horse’s beating.\n  Saying this, Silych instantly emptied the glass entirely,\n  And my actions corresponded to Silych’s exactly:\n  40  I gulped and afterward dispensed some more, with no ceremony,\n  In order not to procrastinate cunningly with the second.\n  And then I says to him, to my dear pal Sila Silych,\n  So here you and I live, so here we chew our daily,\n  But you know what the folks on the other shore are gabbing,\n  45  Many things, honest, on that shore they’re gabbing,\n  “The wolves,” they are gabbing, “ate you there, apparently,”\n  What do you think—are those facts or perhaps just fables?\n  I heard, I heard, they reported to me the news also,\n  The guest rejoined, caressing in unison my ocelot.\n  50  But I am slightly thrown off my kilt and befuddled,\n  Perhaps they ate but perhaps it’s just an empty rumor,\n  It’s anybody’s guess, as Grandma used to say wisely.\n  Then Silych and I had another mouthful, roundly-soundly,\n  Or, as it is commonly called, we redoubled.\n  55  With my friend Silych having seen to the brew’s termination,\n  I decided to incite my friend Silych to engage in something:\n  Why don’t we read at random some of the messages?\n  Right, Yasha, your pate is reasoning properly,\n  Silych answers with dignity my proposition,\n  60  Are we supposed to be worser than the other mail carriers?\n  It’s an unheard of thing not to read someone’s epistles.\n  What other stuff would you expect us to be reading?\n  And then we’ve opened several scrolls together.\n  We look—what kind of stuff people compose to each other,\n  65  With what, it appears, don’t they seem to be concerned:\n  Widely and mightily flows epistle-writing between the people,\n  Like some epidemic it is spreading all over.\n  For instance, Pavel from Gorodnishche writes to Pyotr in Bydogoshch,\n  Begs his uncle to purchase the yeast for hooch-brewing,\n  70  He implores him to find without fail some alphabet letter,\n  He keeps prying, a knife to his throat he is holding,\n  He doesn’t let his uncle get sloshed in the crashbaret even a smidgen.\n  Pyotr from Gorodnishche sharply replies to Pavel in Bydogoshch:\n  My dear, keep up your incessant search for the letter,\n  75  But the money, given by you, I pissed away entirely,\n  Therefore, you should know that the yeast I will bring you unlikely,\n  And besides, Ilya the grinder, a total outsider,\n  In his old age suddenly also became attracted to a stilo,\n  A grievance to Sidor Fomich Pozhilykh he scribbled,\n  80  He complains—during a snowstorm someone lifted his crutches,\n  The wardens of Shallow Reach, he claims, absconded with them.\n  After a while, the whipper-in will also get a document:\n  Hunting-dog master, if there was no necessity to do it,\n  Would I really outline the following to you? Not really.\n  85  Halloo, your people a pair of my supports pilfered,\n  They’d better return them as soon as possible, drifters,\n  Or, tell them, all of you won’t be safe even in heaven.\n  The wardens scratch the birch bark to the grinder collectively,\n  Apparently, the whipper-in passed to them Ilya’s ultimatum:\n  90  Master-buster, a specter both stupid and foolish,\n  We couldn’t care less even if we saw you in the box with your crutches,\n  You’d better hop, bloated, to your lonesome babe at the farmhouse,\n  And if you start snitching—you’ll taste the real misfortune.\n  Having read the writs and with chewed crumbs having resealed them,\n  95  We finished drinking, emptied the spacious jug to the bottom,\n  The time to part arrived then for me and for Silych.\n  Eh, he put on his hat and proceeded to exit,\n  He hugged me, his soul mate, kissed me—and departed.\n  Silych, I said, why is my oncle to me endlessly writing?\n  100  For no reason, he responded, not even a hare to us, the curly.\n  In the meantime, in Bydogoshch, all the alders—florescence.\n\n\nNote XXVII\n\nNot the Firebird’s . . .\n\n\n  Not the firebird’s bright outfit\n  Hops and rumbles in the grass,\n  But Elijah, our prophet,\n  In his chariot rides to us.\n  God be with him! Ergo—thunder!\n  Ergo—lightning! Never mind!\n  So the wardens smoke and wonder\n  Why the rain still lags behind.\n  Lightning turns all things to sterling,\n  In the keeve the mash aboil,\n  And above it stands the twirling,\n  Serpentine condensing coil.\n  And this viper, self-constructed,\n  Source of profit and delight,\n  Was mysteriously abducted\n  From the grinders to this site.\n  We’re not looking for excuses,\n  Well, we pilfered it, so what?\n  He who mocks the poor, abuses\n  His own Maker a whole lot.\n  The procedure is consistent:\n  Wardens wait, the drops still lag.\n  And in contrast—in an instant\n  Tomcat pounces on a bug.\n  Plus, quite often, now as ever,\n  Just to spite us—life’s a flash,\n  And in contrast—lasts forever\n  The most common scraper brush.\n  I will pass. Who would believe this?\n  I was—I’ll be just a ghoul,\n  And the dawn, blind and oblivious,\n  Will trip over my pulped soul.\n  To my lonesome babes’ loud snivel\n  And weed-trampling underfoot,\n  My white body—a soap’s sliver\n  Will be hauled on its last route.\n  But so far—on shore, delighted,\n  In my cap I sit with pals,\n  Please preserve, oh God Almighty,\n  Our rowboats from the squalls.\n  For auspicious outcome hoping,\n  Now, a hunter’s suit I hem,\n  But my needles, darn, are dropping:\n  Ergo—pickled, hence—I am.\n\n",

  title: "Discords Beyond the Itil",
  author: null,
  layout: "narrative",
  content: "We’ve gathered closer to discuss what happened \nbut the orchestrion resounded and we could not \nstop ourselves from a potpoorie. Eh, you gal with \nflair, you’re my dancin pair, with an awkward air, and no longer \nfair. Woe is you, great Gorodnishche, the most mightiest town, \nbriefly flashed through my mind durin the dance. And really. \nPrecisely on that day started these discords Beyond the Itil, \nthat is, these mishaps that are the reason I’m gettin broke payin \nthe office fees. Have you heard the news? Burbots, in love with \nthe moon, try to swim to it thru the air and slowly suck holes in \nice. Similarly, the male species lost their cool and went crazy on \naccount of that dame. They, our crucians, surface on the hillock at dusk, sit on whatever they can, and dream all out about \nher, suckin from the bottle. They’re waitin, hopin she’ll appear \nagain, even though everyone knows she visits rarely, and when \nshe does visit, she can be seen only by the chosen ones, for \nwhom these randevoos, as a rule, turn into a disaster. So let’s \ngive what’s due to the mentioned Gury, Fyodor, Kaluga, or to \nV. Karaban, who did not depart yet but dried up and barks: \nKeeps clearin his throat. Woe is you, Gorodnishche and your \nenvirons; everythin around you is both desolate and false. A \nlonely fellow assures his lonesome babe: I am goin to our backwater to round up some fish. But he’ll circle around the islands, \nmake a few drafts—and all folks suddenly see him among \nthem in the crashbaret havin a glass of vino. The invalidual \nreturns home, starts doin what he did before. We stir up trouble, clown around, mischief-makers, don’t care about anythin, \nit’s disgustin to look at us. Do You think we don’t know the \nproper manners? Ain’t we well bred, as we should? We know, \nwe’re well bred, even hands before eatin, like them Farisees, \nwe strive to wash, but mainly it makes no difference—we misbehave, find ourselves outside of the norms of decency. And \nthe greed overcame us too. We are lyin under the elms, begin \nto celebrate, and various folks appear out of the blue: Won’t \nyou give us some? And we ain’t givin, we are pissed: Scram, \nthe store’s still open, manage your feast yourself, freakin alkies. And thievery, excuse me, thievery out of this world, and it \nturns out there’s nothin to push off with.\n\nI was walkin, keep readin, from the other side of our common river, returnin on Christmas Eve from Gury, from his funeral. The refreshments were provided by that undertaker; he \ninvited: Crawl in, all who want, let’s have a gulp to keep the \nbuzz goin; hearts are trumps. I crawled in. A young fellow was \nrottin, they say, in a Caucasian damp joint, and when the captivity got tiresome—he ran away. And I also got bored with \nthis wake, I wanted to go back to my repairmen, I wanted \nto celebrate Christmas with them. The youngster got lost in \nthe mountains—and I in the dusk. I was skatin homeward, \nand the strong wind was squeezin the tear out, and it—it was \nrollin merrily. So far we’re not missin any screws, we know what \nit means to get our legs shod in blades. Nevertheless, it’s sort \nof sad between the dog in the expanses of native rivers, it makes \nyou feel an urge to whimper like that tramp at a quarter after \nthree. Fog—who knows whether it’s a place or a face, shadow \nor light, Gorodnishche or Bygodoshch: I revved up the tempo. \nA miner’s storm lamp, given to me by the head dog master as \npayment for various minor services, was knockin about in the \nbast creel behind my spine, and there was gurglin in the container. But I did not hurry to light it; in the night blindness it’ll \nget even blinder, so—we call it a bat. Contradiction, blunder. \nAfter all, it doesn’t make itself blind—it makes us blind with \nits rays, therefore it appears we are bats, and bats ain’t us, ever. \nWhy, I hasten to ask, Aladdin Rakhmatullin ain’t among us \nnow, but stays lonely under water? And why did he, the rash \nracer, light his lantern in the grayish air? The homeless clouds \nstiffened, my clothes also stiffened, the ground draft crawled \nup my ankels. And as soon as the timber town, like in a water \ndecal, started faintly showin through the murk, I, old shoe that \nI am, understood that all of its houses are sewn from the ashcolored corduroy with a wide wale, and their roofs from felt, \nor perhaps someone stole from the hat factory undyed matted \nwool. Psst . . . Evenin is bein evenin, folks walk from fact’ry, free, \nMarusya swallowed poison, hospital-bound she’ll be. Who \nknows if from the factory or not, but various river folks kept \nwalkin on hockey and figure skates over this dark blue worsted \nwool; some with an idea of a promenaid, some from the woods \nwith Christmas trees, some to the store, but all of them far, far \naway, not nearby. It turns dreary when one’s alone; I got tense. \nBelieve it or not, but there is someone invisible among us. I \napplied the skate’s brake and extracted the lamp—burn, burn \nbrightly, with fire it’s not as scary. And at that moment I spotted \na wolf behind the snow piles. Don’t be surprised, in winter that \npublic keeps wandrin hither and thither—boatload of tracks. \nThey’re lucky, the animals, that the freeze bridges the waters \nand one can manage without any Doom. Ferry over, they tell \nhim, to the other side a goat, a cabbage, and even a jackaloo. \nOnly not together but in turns, so they don’t finish each other \noff after unloadin. And who will be paired with whom, and \nwho will ride alone—it’s your decision. I don’t wanna carry \neither a goat or a cabbage, said Doom, and much less the other \none, even if in a muzzle; we have enough peripeties at the \ncrossin without that. And when I noticed beyond the snowdrifts the gray hide and the eyes resemblin the precious iridescent Christmas tree ball, I got discouraged, a fearful billy goat. \nIf I run, the predator will give chase, grab by the nape—and \nit’s all over, you’ve bit the dust. Yes, I got anxious, but more \nprecisely—got angry, rebellious. There’s nothin out of the ordinary in dyin, and accordin to the earlier-mentioned reasons, \nit’s required. But to have the master suffer death on account of \nthe primeval beast is inappropriate, rude; one has to get some \nrespect, even if the most tiniest; after all, not all of us are harried \nalive, we’re not a complete ragtag rabble. I won’t succumb to the \npangs of his fangs; I will fight, like that escaped youngster in the \nChuchmek mountains fought, breathin rapidly. I put the bat \ndown on the snow, took off the creel; my courage came back. The \nbeast is sittin, observin, he turned his head sideways. Why are \nyou sorrowful, Wolfie, attack, if you dare. He’s stubborn, doesn’t \ndo it. I take from under my shirt a bread ration of peeled rye \nand beckon: Come, devour, you’re probably starvin. The wolf \nstole up, ferocious, keeps waggin his tail—snap—and swallowed my piece. I was nimble, Citizen Pozhilykh, grabbed \nhim by his collar—and started poundin. It’s no picnic for an \ninvalidual to keep his balance durin such fracases, especially \non a single blade, but some experience had been accumulated; \nhere, rarely a week passes without battles on ice. When we, the \nstumps, gather to twist and turn over the slick, one word leads \nto another; with the prosthesis across the temple—and with \nwhatever is around we start mutilatin our fellow creatures. \nSuch strategies make little sense, of course, but still: Friendship gets stronger and excessive foolishness gets knocked out \nand away. The adversary initially showed obstinacy, just kept \nspinnin around like on a stake, yelpin, but subsequently could \nnot take it—and darted. He overturned Ilya, but as long as the \ncollar held, I was thwartin the flight, and our twosome rolled, \ncompletely wild, dappled white, like devils in the mill. And suddenly my lamp went out, my hand weakened—and the jackaloo flew the coop. And the boozin daze overwhelmed me, I am \nlyin sauced, steamin—like a jellied pike perch on the crystal \nof the Itil. And though the blizzard crawls into the folds of my \nclothes and my hair is splittin—I am delighted. With hand on \nmy heart, where and when else can one experience things like \nthat? What a victory—I overcame the predator. But if you tell \nsomeone—they’ll doubt it: Where’s the hide? We are stalwart \nmaterialists, Pozhilykh, we believe in the hide, but about happiness—we’re on our gard. And from the hill, from the highest \nhill, like the tsar’s decree about clemencies, a huge huntin party \nwas rollin down to the crashbaret, retirin from the watchful \nthickets. Krylobyl was carryin on his shoulder a small kill, and \nthe shooters, up to twelve in number—the corpse of a razorback. It’s intrestin that the mugs of those carriers, due to what \nthey’ve been downin beforehand, became exactly like snouts, \nand they were walkin for some reason on half-bent legs. Congrats, congrats, I greeted the hunters. Rats, rats, they trumpet, \ngloomy as if they had died. Apparently the cold deprived their \ntongues of their rights. Happy approachin, I said. Roachin, garbled Krylobyl, poachin. Listen, what a pleasant twilight, I said, \nevenin’s smokin. Right, agreed the old man, croakin.\n\nAt last I’ve rolled up to my destination, and I tumble into the \nworkshop. By these hours the entire grindin co-op gathered \nthere—it gathered, started frolickin. Some got involved in the \nsacrilegious beetle, others in the break-them-up, and some, not \nafraid of hernia, allowed themselves to play juggle ball, firmin \nup a few rags together with twine. They behave outrageously, \ndissolutely, and to straighten them up, to slap them on the \nwrist, there’s positively nobody; happy-go-lucky behaviors had \nspread all over—a million of them. And then, havin gulped \nsome plunk, I flung at my colleagues the Christmas Eve confession-homily. About-goners and youngsters, I summoned, more \nthan a thousand years ago, Mary the Southerner gave birth to \nthe Son of Man. He grew up and, in particular, announced: If \neven one palm corrupts you—don’t be shy, cut it off immediately. ’Cuz how much more wonderful it is to partially flourish \nin these here times than smolder whole in that Gehenna. We’re \nall amputees, and our future is bright. Take, for example, me \npersonally. An offspring of my mother and father, permanent \nfools in Christ from the stoop of Vagankovo and All Saints, \nrespectively, I began the same way, but after the famed event, \nmy cursed fate, fanned with carbolic acid and insence, changes \nto the core. I engage in various trades and learn them—inside \nout. As a result of my wandrin ordeals, in their conclusion, I \narrive here and join this co-op. I am standin here in front of \nyou, you all know me. Let the abomination of complete desolation, the flabby, decrepit, and slurrin dwarf with a woodpecker \nbeak, descend on us tomorrow at lunch. But even in front of \nher mugognomy I will claim, sayin it with pride, that I know \nno name loftier than the modest soberquet of the Russian riverside grinder. And if I hear a thunderin voice—throw Your \nknives-scissors away, but sharpen, if You know what I mean, for \nthe sake of the common good the right shore of the Itil until it’s \nan awesome sting, similar to a scythe, then I will answer: You \nasked for it, You got it! But don’t be envious that from the outside I am mighty and tough—inside I am simply a softy. And \nwhether I grind my teeth or metal—I just grind them, while \nmy longin after Orina is grindin me. What a woman, one won’t \nforget her at any price. But don’t cast dispersions, better repent. All of you did secure for yourself permanent honey pies, \nbut the sweetness of the unknown ladies, of the temporary \nones, attracts, and you desire them, committin a sin. I know, \nyou pity your usual lonesome babes ’til death do you part, ’cuz, \nfortifyin themselves, they endure the unbearable burdens of \nyour corrupt bodies and natures. But you also fell in love with \nthe visitin dame, and you love her devotedly, even though she’s \nnobody to you, and I will call this, like the scandals and thievery, Discords Beyond the Itil. In principle, one should bring \ndown fire on you, but I will wait a bit ’cuz I am also no angel, \nno better than you—I’m registered with one, share a household \nwith her, but I am burnin for another. That’s why the tall tales \nof crickets behind the stove are bothering llya. The moment \nI hear them—our outins and rides to suburban little towns \nwith grasshoppers come to the surface. So don’t cast dispersions and that’s the end of it. In those tipsy periods, different \nvisitors like tinkers, buoy keepers, and loggers appeared here. \nThey made excuses—we were drawn to the light—but in fact \ncame to get treated for free. And they inquired: Won’t you reveal who bangothumped all the mange out from the dog-master’s bitch? Gentlemen, I have no clue; if the jackaloo, then yep, \nhe did get beat up—tufts were flyin all over. And I gave them \nmy account of the battle, receivin a shower of applause. When \nthe holidays ended, I leave the co-op and, a braggart, ascend to \nGorodnishche. Yearnin after homemade pancakes was drivin \nme under the warm roof; I also needed some tenderness. What \ndid I understand, wandrin—how everythin is arranged? I did \nnot understand nothin, wandrin, includin how everythin is arranged. I only see every lonesome babe is a trap net, Fomich, \nshe’s a trap net, and we—we’re ordinary ruffs, and sooner or \nlater we’ll be hers. Do You remember that case: a drawin called \nUnexpected Return? I also lumbered back, filled with remorse, \nand she’s beratin me: What, you lumbered back, you darned \nlame horse? I could not bear such slander, on Candlemas I \ngave my hands free rein, but my pal-gal did not fall far behind, \ntook advantage of my condition. After that we made peace, \nshe got generous and fried pancakes for me, and later even allowed me to get close. As soon as the mornin has broken, I \njump out into the entrance hall—my indispensable accessories are missin, though I, bein of sound mind and memory, left \nthem there, in a pickle barrel, and even covered them with a \nlid. I got used to keepin them there—my lonesome babe, Her \nNeatfreakness, does not permit me to bring crutches into the \nchambers: Even with your single sole there’s plenty of trouble, \nI just walk behind you and keep wipin. And I: But you yourself \nhusk the sunflower seeds on the floor. And she: I haven’t asked \nyou what I can husk; so far it’s not me who’s a squatter here but \nyou. I looked at the porch—analogy. The witch was already \nwarmin up the chow on the stovetop. My friend, quoth I to \nthat woman, why did you dispatch my supports into the stove \nfor the benefit of the ever-burnin fire? Eh, you don’t know what \nyou’re babblin, she cuts me off. In that case—they got filched, \nI concluded. Serves you right, she scoffed, how many times I \nwarned you not to be lazy to stick the bolt in the latch in the \nevenin—and you didn’t even prick up your ears, so now sort it \nout. No, it serves you right, you pipette, it was you who forced \nme to leave them in the entrance hall, so from now on you’ll \nhave to drive Ilya everywhere on a sled, ’cuz personally I find \nno evidence of any savins to purchase a new pair, and whether \nyou will have enough strength to meddle with the wretch or \nnot—it’s nobody’s concern, and on which sled are you plannin \nto pull me on May Day, it doesn’t worry me in the least. Yakyak-yak, she utters, yak-yak-yak, the tattered chatterbox. The \nsame day, I discovered by the gate a note delivered on the sly, \nsecured with the indecent elastic from underwear and entitled: Affidavit. I’m quotatin: Given to Citizen I. P. Sindirela \nand attestin that his accessories went missin in connection \nwith the fact that on such-and-such date of the river-freezin \nmonth he walloped with them the huntin bitch Mumu, therefore it’s unlikely they’ll be returned to him; the wardens of the \nShallow Reach. So I scribble to their whipper-in—a wolf. The \nwhipper-in responds—a Vizsla. And our chronicle started. It \nstarted and continues and I am sittin here without stirrin, stuck \nin place. My professional calluses slowly begin to shrink, and \ninstead I am developin writin ones. What else am I involved \nin? I keep fightin with my scatterbrain, I recall for her zesty \nchastushkas: Girls once argued at the dacha which one had the \nshaggiest cha-cha; it turned out the shaggiest cha-cha had the \nowner of the dacha. She’s gigglin—like a jingle bell. In addition, I am gazin at the past—my journeys, wandrins.\n\nSo depict somethin for farewell, the courier kept grievin, start \nsomethin ours, make it as heartrendin as possible, or play \nsomethin general railroad-like. I yanked the bellows and the \ninspector’s providin description. He’s providin description and \nI am singin: To distant destination will soon depart the train, \nthe cars will leave the station, the platform will remain. The \nstation has a clock, the brick wall is all red, the kerchiefs a white \nflock, the eyes so deeply sad. Uh, that’s a great one, grieved the \nbro. I am singin and he reports. About the hunt, about the time \nwhen, not so long ago, he went huntin for the firebird, and how, \non the approach to Zhmerinka, someone shamelessly carried \noff from the car his huntin boots. Or how in his youth a certain \nperson lost her head gazin at him; she served at the N-junction, \nwith a motley schlagbauman, and the lieutenant, in those years \na cornet, paid zero attention. The smokin car will ask about my \nnow, my past, I’ll tell a bunch of crap to shock and make them \npout. What truly I gave up they don’t need to find out. Durin \nthe hunt, flabbergasted by the theft, he shot at the target but \nmissed, and now, attired in regalia, but havin wasted the entire century, he’s got the feelin that he blew off the most importantest bird of his fate, very likely not around Zhmerinka \nbut on that motleyish switch, givin the gal the cold shoulder. \nAnd they found her, he says, at the foot of the embankment. \nA sailor in striped shirt will open his poor heart, he’ll say that \nhe is hurt and that his life is hard. He’ll reach his destination, \nwon’t look back at the train, the cars will leave the station, the \nplatform will remain. I sang and suffered: Oh, you swallow of \nmine, for whom did you leave me, havin taken the son and \nhavin changed your and his last name, and where are you both \nright now—nobody knows. On the Don’s shore, a branch of \nmaple, and on your kerchief, soaked through with tears. You \nwere called around the barracks Orina Neklina, and to whom \ndo you belong now, to what kind of, let’s suppose, Spacklin, \nah? And the sailor—the sailor You met in the car—have You \nfigured out who he was? Earlier I also didn’t know who he was, \nfrom which fleet, lost or discharged? He seemed so unknown \nthat one could erect a monument to him. Right now I believe \nhe was the sailor Albatrosov, discharged for good. Be patient, \nwe got acquainted as the train went on. And the deputy started \nweepin, can’t enjoy the song enough. You see, a Russian tune \nmoves even the big ranks, so what do You expect from me, a \ntiny worm—I completely lost it. And if one looks out of the \nwindow—there’s also not much joy: shacks made of timber, \nDecember. And some vagabond Gypsy—exactly like us—with \na sack on a stick and bunches of pretzels on his neck instead of \nnecklaces, tramples the shroud of native expanses, and even if \nhe acts like the devil-may-care, we read in his eyes that the situation sucks, that wandrins are distant and constant, even if \nnot personally for us, and when we croak, it will be the others’ \nturn, and no special indulgences are anticipated. My past and \npresent fiascos I esplained in two words—and it was rockin on \nswitches. You may get envious: Yes, Ilya, you are truly blessed, \nyou suffered and knew much sorrow. Don’t say that, I says, I’m \nso blessed that I could cry. We took a swig, swallowed. Hittin \nthe sack?—the inspector hiccupped. I tell him: I’m not sleepy, \nI got enough sleep in hospitals. Gonna brush your teeth? \nPardon? Your teeth, I am askin, he asks, are you gonna brush? \nI apologize, I—pas, I don’t need to. Coincidence, he said, both \njaws ain’t mine. So whose?—I stared. Official issue, on suction \ncups, said the lieutenant, here. And he took them out. I looked. \nI did like them a great deal—white, sharp, as if a bonesetter \nprescribed; here’s what your health services do. Go ahead, \ntry them, try them, don’t be shy, the lieutenant encouraged. I \ninserted. How are they, do they fit? Like in a pharmacy, lieutenant, as if they sculpted these details for Ilya. It’s a gift, he \nyelled. Oh my, are you nuts, how’s that possible, such presents. \nAin’t you my kin, he kept yellin, don’t I have the right to offer \nmy bro the teeth? Suck and remember. Well, what a benefactor, \nyou helped me out, I yelled. Forget it, the deputy grinned to \nme, empty-mouthed, just play. I started singin, playin—swiftly, \nswiftly, as if escapin from the Siberian mines. The inspector \ndoesn’t give a spit about close quarters—he broke into a bop, \nkeeps shakin his charms. In our blessed memory’s early years \nwe called such fellows blubberlubbers: No problem, they all \nresponded without fail. I was performin “Carousel,” probably \nin the rhythm of the squabble of the wheels. A filigree “Carousel”: Shake your lure, I cheered him on, chevelure. And in the \nsame rhythm a fortunate thought came to Ilya that, say, he unexpectedly put in the gratis teeth. Ah, I put in the new teeth, eh, \nthe new teeth I put in fast, I put them in myself, and so forth. \nTo the accompaniment of squeakin wheel flanges, a thoughtful \ninvalidual will mill over all kinds of stuff durin a long trip from \nan infirmary to the Tower Junction; he will mill it over—and \nthere will be flour. And it was rockin on switches. My bopper \nbopped ’til he dropped: He crashed on the berth and started \nsawin wood. So I took off his tall boots lined with fur, threw \nthem for good memories into the knapsack, polished off what \nwas left in the flask—for the road—and I greet the sailor in \nthe car’s gangway: On leave to maman? Durin our cabotage, \nhe says, the followin emergency occurred. On the Mariupol \ndry-cargo ship served two chums, two stokers—the second \nand the first—and the sea spread in front of them quite widely. \nBut when the second, out of the most sincerest considerations \nfor his attachment to the first’s gal from Anapa, secretly added \nto his antrasite some kind of bad substance and left, they were \ncruisin precisely to Balaklava, to the factory of bubbly water. \nThe comrade left, so this one opens the door to the furnace \nwith a habitual bump—and it’s all over. That is, when he \nswooshed his shovel into the ash pit and shoved it in up to, as \nthey say in them fleets, its turnip and started stirrin with the \nshovel, then everythin went kaboom—a total nightmare. And \nthe flame illuminated him. At that time the other stoker runs \ninto the boiler room, and this one says to him: Stand from under, we’re havin a malfunction, our valves and all their flaps are \ngone—for that reason, gimme a cig, bro, stick it in my kisser, so \nthe smoke comes out of me. I don’t mind givin, his bro teases \nhim, only with what, I would like to know, do you intend to \nhold it? I looked, he says, and it seems I have no palms, they got \ntorn off—a tear glimmers in his eye—and it’s a done deal. And \nI, he says, said then, a stoker to a stoker: Darn, you call yourself \na pal, but stokerly speakin, you are a mop after that, not a sailor, \nand your mother’s a bulkhead.\n",

  content: "Содвинулись все происшествие обсуждать, но тут раздался оркестрион, и от попурри не воздержались. Эх, шерочка, да ты машерочка, косолапочка, престарелочка. Горе тебе, Городнище большое, \nмощнеющий град, в минуту пляски у меня мелькнуло немножечко. \nИ действительно. Именно с того дня есть-пошла эта смутная Заитильщина, то есть те нелады, ради коих и разоряюсь на канцелярии. \nСлышали новость? Налимы, в луну влюбленные, с целью к ней воздусями проплыть, исподволь лунки во льду просасывают. Наподобье того и мужицкая особь сбеленилась и тронулась из-за дамы \nтой. Выплывут, карасики, в смутный час на бугор, сядут на что попало и мечтают напропалую о ней, из горла посасывая. Ждут, что \nснова она наведается, хоть любому известно — бывает редко, а когда и бывает, то зрят лишь считаные, которым свиданки эти, как \nправило, идут не впрок. Воздадим тем же Гурию, Федору, Калуге \nили же Карабану В., кто пока что не отошел, но усох и лает: першит. \nГоре, горе тебе, Городнище с окрестностями, все вокруг и пустое, \nи ложное. Заверяет бобыль бобылку: еду на затон поботать. Но покрутится меж островов, сделает немного тоней — и все его видят \nвдруг среди себя в кубарэ за чашкой вина. Возвращается индивид \nво свои круги, берется за прежнее. Баламутим, чудим, проказники, \nни о чем не печемся, отвратно на нас поглядеть. Полагаете, достойных манер не знаем? не благовоспитаны, как надлежит? Знаем, благовоспитаны, руки даже перед едой, фарисейничая, умыть норовим, \nно в основном все одно — бедокурим, не в рамках приличия состоим. Жадность также нас обуяла. Лежим под вязами, затрапезничаем, и подвизаются разные: а нам не предложите? А мы не даем, мы \nхаем: ступайте, еще открыто, соображайте в своем пиру, алкаши \nтакие. И татьба, извините, татьба несусветная, и отпихнуться сделалось нечем как есть.\n\nШел, читайте, из-за всеобщей реки, выдвигаясь в сочельник от \nГурия, с его похорон. Угощение обустроил тот погребальщик, он \nприглашал: заползайте, желающие, куликнем на старые дрозжи, черви козыри. Я заполз. Гнил парнишка, рассказывают, в кавказском \nсыром кичмане, а надоело в неволе — бежал. А наскучила и мне эта \nтризна, захотелось к своим починщикам, с ними захотелось вкусить \nРождества. Затерялся мальчонка в горах — я в сумерках. Я катил \nвосвояси, и вихорь слезу вышибал, и она же катилась радостно. Щи \nне лаптем хлебаем покудова, соображаем, что значит острым ногу \nнабуть. Грустновато тем не менее между собакой на просторе родимых рек, хныкать вас подмывает, как того побирошу в четверть \nчетвертого. Хмарь, ни кожа ни рожа, ни тень ни свет, ни в Городнище, ни в Быгодоще: взвинтил я темп. Штормовая лампа горняцкая, \nдаренная главным псарем за долги в счет мелких услуг, телепалась \nв пéщере за плечьми, и во фляге ее побулькивало. Но возжечь не \nспешил, в курослеп еще хуже выслепит, и вот — называем летучая \nмышь. Противоречье, погрех. Слепит не ее ведь — нас лучами ее \nслепит, мы, выходит, летучая мышь, а летучая мышь не мы никогда. \nПочему, разрешу спросить, Аладдин Рахматуллин не с нами, а подо \nльдом скучает сейчас? А чего ж, скороход опрометчивый, лампаду \nв сероватости засветил. Залубенели бездомные облака, залубенело \nи платье мое, поползла поземка по щиколку. И лишь город бревенчат картинкой сводною сквозь муть проступил, понял я, чуня, что \nдомы его все шиты из пепловатого такого вельвета с широким рубцом, и кровли их — войлок, а может, с фабри́чки шляпной некрашеный фетр снесли. Чу, вечер вечереет, все с фабрички идут, Маруся \nотравилась, в больничку повезут. С фабрички — не с фабрички, но \nшагал на гагах и снегурах по тому ли по синему гарусу различный \nречник; кто с променада целью, кто из лесу с елками, кто в магазин, \nно все далеко-далеко, не близко. Неприютно оборачивается одному, \nрастревожился. Веришь не веришь, но есть кое-кто тут невидимый \nсреди нас. Тормознул и светильник достал — гори-гори ясно, с огнем храбрей. И тут волка я усмотрел за сувоями. Не удивляйтесь, \nзимой эта публика так и снует семо-овамо, следов — угол. Лафа им, \nживотным, что вóды мороз мостит, и без всякой Погибели обойдешься. Перевези, ему говорят, на ту сторону козу, капусту и даже чекалку. Только не сразу, а в два приема, чтобы не извели друг дружку по \nвыгрузке. И кто с кем в паре поедет, а кто один — решение за тобой. \nНи козу, ни капусту везти не желаю, Погибель сказал, а тем паче \nего, пусть и в наморднике, перипетий нам на переправе хватает \nи без того. И когда усмотрел за суметами серую шкуру и глаз наподобие шара бесценного елочного с переливами, то заскучал я, козел \nбоязненный. Побежать — увяжется хищник, в холку вцепится — \nи пиши пропало, копыта прочь. Да, смутился, но более осерчал, возмутился. Умирать нам отнюдь не в диковину, а по изложенным выше причинам и надлежит. Но от твари дремучей мастеру смерть принимать неприлично, неудобняк, уважение, хоть малеющее, дóлжно \nк себе заиметь, мы ведь все же не вовсе заживо угнетенные, не вовсе \nшушерский сброд. Не отдамся на угрызение, стану биться, как бился \nтот беглый парнишка в чучмекских горах, торопливо дыша. Мышь \nлетучую поставил на снег, скинул пéщер, ободрился. Зверь сидит, \nнаблюдает, голову набок склонил. Что кручинишься, Волче, налетай, \nколи смел. Уперся, нейдет. Достаю из запазухи горбулю обдирную \nи маню — на-ка, слопай, голодом, вероятно, сидишь. Волк подкрался, свирепый, хвостом так и машет — хап — и пайку мою заглотнул. \nИзловчился я, гражданин Пожилых, ухватил его за ошейник — и ну \nкостылять. Мудрено индивиду в таких переплетах баланс удерживать, в особенности на лезвиé, ну да опыт накоплен кое-какой, без \nледовых побоищ у нас недели тут не случается. Как сойдемся, обрубки, на скользком пофигурять — слово за слово, протезом по темечку — и давай чем ни попадя ближнему увечия причинять. Толку \nмало, конечно, в подобных стратегиях, однако есть: дружба крепче \nда дурость лишнюю вышибает долой. Супостат изначально упорство выказал, вертелся лишь, как на колу, скуля, но не вынес впоследствии — рванулся, Илью завалил, но, доколе ошейник выдерживал, \nя побегу препятствовал, и валялись мы оба-два дикие все, белесые, \nровно черти в амбаре. А вдруг лампада моя угасла, рука моя ослабела — чекалка утек. И взяла меня дрема хмельная, лежу испитóй, \nраспаренный — судачок заливной на хрустале Итиля. И пускай заползает заметь в прорухи одежд, пускай волос сечется — мне сладостно. Положа руку на сердце, где еще и когда выпадает подобное \nиспытать, ну и виктория — хищника перемог. А поведать кому — \nусомнится: где шкура-то. Черствые матерьялисты мы, Пожилых, \nв шкуру верим, а в счастье остерегаемся. А с холма, с холма высочайшего, словно государев о поблажках указ, пребольшая охота валила вдоль кубарэ, ретируясь из чутких чащ: Крылобыл на хребтине малую тушку нес, а стрелки́, числом до двенадцати, — вепря \nтруп. Интересно, что рожи у тех носильщиков от выпитого за срокá \nстали точно такие же, колуном, да и шли они как-то на полусогнутых. С полем, с полем, охотников я поздравлял. Олем, олем, мрачные они трубят, будто умерли. Очевидно, мороз языки их в правах \nпоразил. С наступающим, я сказал. Ающим, Крылобыл передернул, \nлающим. Славный, слышь, выдался вечерок, говорю, приятные сумерки. Ок, старик согласился, умерки.\n\nНаконец докатился я, заваливаюсь в цеха. Там сошлась к тем часам вся точильная шатия — сошлась, разыгралась. Где в жучка святотатственного завелись, где в расшиши́, а некоторые, грыжи не \nубоясь, чеканку себе позволили, тряпок несколько на живую нитку \nсплотив. Озорничают, разгульничают, а одернуть, поставить на вид \nположительно  некому,  вольгот  развелось  всемерных  —  мильён. \nИ тогда, хватанув рассыпухи, сказанул я коллегам сочельную исповедь-проповедь. Доходяги и юноши, я призвал, больше тысячи лет \nназад родился у южанки Марии Человеческий Сын. Вырос и, в частности, возвестил: ежели хоть единая длань соблазняет тебя — не \nсмущайся: немедленно отсеки. Потому что куда прекраснее отчасти \nво временах благоденствовать, нежели целиком в геенне чадить. \nВсе мы усекновенные, и грядущее наше светло. Взять того же меня. \nОтпрыск своих матери и отца, штатных юродивых с папертей Ваганьковской и Всех Святых соответственно, начинал я с того же, \nно после известного происшествия судьба моя окаянная, овеянная \nкарболкой и ладаном, меняется вкруть. Припускаюсь в различные \nпромыслы и профессий осваиваю — куда с добром. В результате \nмытарствий, в итоге их, прибываю сюда и зачисляюсь в эту артель. \nПредстою я тут перед вами, вы все меня знаете. Пусть нагрянет \nк нам завтра в обед Мерзость полнеющего запустения, карла одряблая, дряхлая и картавая: с дятлым клювом. Но инда и перед ее физиомордией я скажу, говоря и с гордостью, что не ведаю выше имени, чем скромное прозывание русского по-над-речного точильщика. \nИ если грянет мне голос — да брось ты свои ножи-ножницы, заточи, \nпонимаешь, ради общего дела Итиль по правому берегу до грозного \nжала, навроде косы, то отвечу: пожалте бриться. Но не завидуйте, \nчто снаружи могуч и сухарь, — я внутри прямо нежный. И точу ли \nс кем лясы, железы ль — я их, а меня — по Орине грусть. Что за женщина, не изживешь ни за что. Но не корите, а кайтесь. Не у всех ли \nиз вас завелись знакомки свои постоянные, но на медок потягивает \nк незнакомкам, к непостоянным, вожделеете ко греху. Знаю, бобылок своих привычных жалеете до гробовой доски, ибо тел и натур \nваших порченых неудобоносимые бремена они крепясь переносят. \nНо возлюбили также и даму пришлую, и лю́бите беззаветно, которая вам никто, и это тоже наравне с безобразиями и татьбой нареку Заитильщиной. Огнь, в принципе, надо б на вас низвесть, но пока \nпогожу, потому что и я же хорош, сам не лучше — с одной прописан, \nхозяйство веду, а по другой пламенею. Потому-то и донимают Илью \nпобасенками запечные эти сверчки. Чуть заслышу — всплывут наши с ней вылазки и поездки по пригородным городкам с кузнечиками. Так не корите, и дело с концом. В те хмельные периоды возникали различные пришлые типа лудильщиков, бакенщиков, щепенникóв. \nИзвинялись — на огонек, а в действительности — на дармовщину. \nИ они заодно разведывали: не подскажете, кто это из суки псаревой \nпаршу всю повыколошматил? Господá, я в неведеньи, вот чекалку — \nда, его били, клочочки по закоулочкам. И выдал им про баталью, \nсорвав приличный аплодисмент. По прошествии праздников покидаю артель — восхожу, бахвал, в Городнище. Тоска по домашней оладье гнала под приютный кров, желалось и ласковости. Что я понял, \nбродя, — через что все устроено? Ничего я не понял, бродя, в том \nчисле через что все устроено. Вижу только — бобылка есть вентерь, \nФомич, она — вентерь, а ты — натуральный ерш, и пораньше, попозже — но ты ее. Помните случай: Не ждали — рисунок такой? Я тоже \nпритек, покаянный, она же бранит: что, притек, окаянный? Понапраслины не стерпел, распустил я тем Сретеньем руки, но и приятельница в долгу не осталась, воспользовалась моим обстоятельством. После чего примирились, оладий, раздобрившись, напекла, а там \nи до себя допустила. Едва проерыщилось, выскакиваю в сенцы — \nнет моих принадлежностей неотъемлемых, а оставил их тут в твердой памяти, в огуречной кадушке, крышкой даже прикрыл. Их держать тут привык — бобыльское ее чистоплюйство с костылями в горницу не велит: оно и с одною подошвой вашей хлопот полон рот, \nподтирай за вами ходи. А подсолнухи сами нá пол лущите. Вас я не \nспросила, чего мне лущить, не я здесь покуда жиличка у вас, но вы. \nПоглядел на крыльце — аналогия. Ведьма варево на лежанке тогда \nразогревала уже. Друг мой, я женщине этой рек, отчего вы опоры \nмои в печь отправили в угоду огню негасимому? Ой, плетете вы сами не знаете что, окорачивает. В таком разе спроворены, я заключил. Поделом вам, глумилась, ведь сколь упреждала, чтоб с вечера \nне отлынивали штырь в щеколду совать, — и ухом вы не вели, вот \nи расхлебывайте. Нет, это вам поделом, пипетка вы этакая, это вы \nзаставляли в тамбуре их оставлять, значит обязаны отныне Илью \nповсюду на санках возить, ибо новую пару приобрести я лично не \nусматриваю накоплений, а хватит ли у вас сил с убогим возиться, \nне хватит ли — никого не касается, а на которых салазках первомаем рассчитываете выгуливать, и вовсе не беспокоит. Тэ-тэ-тэ, твердит, тэ-тэ-тэ, тараторка трепаная. В сей же день я обрел у ворот подметную грамоту, обмотанную срамной резиной от панталон и называемую — расписка. Цитатую. Дана гражданину И. П. Синдирела \nв том, что его принадлежности плакали в связи с тем, что того-то \nчисла ледостава-месяца он метелил ими гончую суку Муму, а возвращены ему будут вряд ли бы; мелкоплесовские егеря. И строчу \nя ихнему доезжачему — волк. Доезжачий ответствует — выжловка. \nИ пошла у нас летопись. Она шла и идет, а я сиднем сижу-посиживаю. Профмозоли мои начинают понемногу сдавать, да зато набиваю писчие. Чем еще увлечен я? С дурындой грызусь, частушки ей \nвспоминаю смачные. Девки спорили на даче, у кого чего лохмаче, \nоказалось, что лохмаче у хозяйки этой дачи. Заливается — колокольчиком. Еще прошлое озираю — путешествия, странствия.\n\nА изобрази на прощанье чего-нибудь, разъездной горевал, заделай нашу, побеспризорнее, или же общежелезнодорожное наиграй. \nРастянул я меха, а инспектор описывает. Он описывает — я пою. На \nТихорецкую, я пою, состав отправится, вагончик тронется, перрон \nостанется, стена кирпичная, часы вокзальные, платочки белые, глаза печальные. Ух, нормальная, брат горевал. Я пою — он докладывает. Про охоту, про то, как отправился он на охоту по жароптице не так \nдавно и ботинки его охотничьи на подступах к Жмеринке внаглую \nиз вагона снесли. Или про то, как загляделась на него в его молодости персона, служившая на энском разъезде, где пестроватый шлагбауман, а поручик, в те годы корнет, — ноль внимания. Начнет расспрашивать купе курящее про мое прошлое, про настоящее, налью \nс три короба — пусть поражаются, с чем распрощалась я — их не \nкасается. На охоте, ошарашенный кражей, по цели выпалил, да не \nпопал, но теперь, весь в регалиях, но век до нитки спустя, рассуждает, что главнеющую птицу судьбы проворонил, скорее всего, не под \nЖмеринкой, а на том пестроватом разъезде, деваху мурыжа холодно. Вот и нашли ее, говорит, под насыпью. Откроет душу всю матрос в тельняшечке, как тяжело-то жить ему, бедняжечке, сойдет на \nстанции и не оглянется, вагончик тронется — перрон останется. Пел \nи мучился: ласточка ты моя, на кого покинула, сына забрав и фамилию обменяв ему и себе, и где вы оба сейчас — кто вас ведает. На \nберег Дона, на ветви клена, на твой заплаканный платок. Величали \nтебя по баракам — Орина Неклина, чья теперь ты, какого, положим, \nПаклина? А матросик — моряк-то, который в купе тебе встретился, — смекаешь ли кто? Прежде и я не знал — кто такой, какого флота, пропал или списан? Такой неизвестный казался, хоть памятник \nставь. Ныне верю — матрос Альбатросов, и списан вчистую. Возьмите терпенье, знакомство с ним наше по ходу поезда. А попечитель \nслезу распустил, все песней не налюбуется. Видите, русский наигрыш даже и крупных чинов прошибает, а что уж с меня, с мизерного, взять — я очень расстроился. А посмотреть за окошко — там тоже веселого мало: хибары, декабрь. И какой-нибудь цы́ган, сума \nпереметная — копия нас, — с котомкой на палке и связками сушек на \nшее заместо монист, — топчет саван родимых пространств, и пусть \nдержится кандибобером, в очах его прочитаем, что положение швах, \nчто брести далеко и всегда, пусть порой и не лично нам, а подохнем — настанет других черед, и поблажек особенных не предвидится. Худь свою прошлую и настоящую я в двух словах изложил — \nи мотало на стрелках. Да, блажен, блажен ты, Илья, позавидуешь, \nпретерпел и хлебнул как следует. Не говори, говорю, так блажен — \nчто-то дикое. Опрокинули, пропустили. На боковую? — инспектор \nикнул. Я — ему: не потягивает, я по больницам свое добрал. Зубы \nчистить пойдешь? Виноват? Зубы, спрашиваю, спрашивает, пойдешь \nчистить? Извиняюсь, я — пас, не требуется. Совпадение, он сказал, \nобе челюсти не свои. А чьи же? — я посмотрел. Государственные, на \nприсосках, поручик сказал, на. И вынул. Я посмотрел. Понравились \nсильным образом — белые, острые, что костоправ прописал, вот санитария шагает. А ты примерь, примерь, не стесняйся, поручик подбил. Я вправил. Ну как, приходятся? Как в аптеке, поручик, как на \nИлью они эти детали лили. Дарю, он вскричал. Что ты, что ты, возможно ль, такие презенты. Сродственник ты или нет, он вскричал, \nимею я право брательнику зубы преподнести: соси и помни. Ну добродетель, ну выручил, я всплакнул. Не бери в голову, попечитель \nсмеялся мне, пусторотый, играй. Я запел, заиграл — бегло-бегло, \nсловно бы из сибирских руд. Горя мало инспектору, что теснота, — \nв пляску ударился, прелестями трясет. В светлой памяти юности \nмы таких паренечков жиртрестами прозывали: ничего, откликались \nкак миленькие. Карусель я заделывал, вероятно, в ритме перебранки\nколес. Карусель филигранную: шевелись, раззадоривал, шевелюра. \nИ находила на Илью в том же ритме удачная мысль, что, мол, зубы \nвставил негаданно задарма. Ай, зубы вставил я, эх, зубы вставил \nвдруг, мне зубы вставил сам и так далее. Чего только не перемелет \nрусский дурак за дальнюю дорогу из лазарета в Терем под скрип \nреборд; перемелет — и станет мука. И мотало на стрелках. До упаду \nплясун мой плясал: завалился на полку — и храповицкого. Снял \nя, значит, ботинки с него высокие меховые, бросил на добрую меморию в заплечный мешок, добрал, что оставалось в баклашке, — на \nпосошок, и приветствую в тамбуре моряка: на побывку, до маменьки? Вышло, говорит, у нас в каботаже нижеследующее чепэ. Плавали на мариупольском сухогрузе два кореша, два кочегара — второй \nи первый, и море раскинулось им вполне ширóко. Но ведь когда \nвторой из лучших соображений привязанности к анапской пацанке \nпервого подбросил ему в антрацит какое-то нехорошее вещество \nи ушел, то шли они как раз в Балаклаву, на завод газводы. Товарищ \nушел, он дверь топки привычным толчком отворил — и готово дело. \nЗначит, когда он врубил поддув и посунул свой шобер по самую, \nкак выражаются на флотах, сурепку и пошел этим шобером шуровать, то шарахнуло — полный кошмар. И пламя его озарило. Тут \nзаскакивает в котельное отделение тот кочегар, а кочегар ему: вот, \nполундра, имеем аварию, плакали наши золотники со всеми их клапанами — дай мне в зубы, братишка, по этому поводу, чтоб дым из \nменя пошел. Дать не жалко, братишка над ним ухмыляется, только \nчем ты ее, папиросину, желал бы я знать, прихватить имеешь в виду? Я посмотрел, говорит, а у меня кистей моих что-то нет, оторвало — слезой блестит, — как отрезало. И я, говорит, сказал тогда — \nкочегар кочегару: тоже мне, кореш еще называется, кочегарически \nговоря, швабра ты после этого, а не матрос — и мать твоя переборка.\n",

  content: "The hoarfrost—may pass. The chickens—may walk \nover the sand, looking surprised that they leave \nprints with their chicken feet. Not to like these birds, \nbut to like watching how they leave prints on the wet sand, \nwithout suspecting it, without suspecting anything. The chatterboxes could be heard. They kept shouting to each other but \ndid not halloo because they were walking together, in a tight \nflock. Moira, who was spending her overripe years on the \nbench in the front yard, also heard the voices. Then she put \naside her knitting needles, with which she had been picking in \nher ears since morning, jumped up, looked carefully in that direction, and cawed: They are leading her. A ball of gray wool \nrolled off her knees, hopped on the flower bed, and, crushing \nthe anemic anemones, rolled somewhere, having turned into a \nball of courting vipers. The barracks—may wait. Stepping into \nthe space of April delight, they kept saying: They are leading \nher; she has had enough swinging. The complex, mixed smell \nof roll-ups and state-rolled papirosy may soar above the gathering of the interested. Not to know anybody here. The delinquent tenant, living in the truncated room under the stairs, was \noutside; he may hang out at the water reservoir, near the boathouses, begging shameless oarswomen for candy wrappers. \nBrawny trainers, people of middle age, humiliated the \nscrounger. She was walking with her hair loose, having thrown \nher head back to see only the azure. Her white demi-saison coat \nis unbuttoned. But tomorrow it will get warmer—and she is \nalready in a sarafan. And the witches—in black. The highway is \nviolet, covered with purple puddles, and if we continue with \nthe colors, with impressions—then the tiny young leaves, on \nthe background of which the walk is taking place, convey to \nus the impression of green smoke. Two ghastly skin-and-bones \nare holding her under her arms. The others are walking in a \ncircle, guarding, and all are trying to touch. For a long time, for \nseveral moments, he has been observing what was happening \nthere; he has been observing it from his window for several years. \nAt first—just once; later—occasionally and then—constantly. \nWhenever, wherever: the black jubilant centipede, the hunchbacked semibasement wood louse. The time of year and day is \nchanging, the long dresses of the flock are turning into longskirted sacks. The decorations and lighting and the footwear of \nthe extras are changing, but their gestures, grimaces, and gait \ndo not show any variations. When it is October and the melted \nbutter of the slush spreads on the stale zwieback of the blacktop; whether there is fog, and mildew, God’s false milky dew, \noozes down the gutters of the old women’s wrinkles; if it is late, \ndark, and the pieces of glass from broken bottles glimmer neither in the harbor nor in the trash of garbage piles; or when \nJanuary puts wind-and-snow gags in the thin-lipped mouths of \nthe babblers; or February-crooked-paths, having outfitted \nitself with the pincers of snowstorms, tries to tear out the sinewy tongues of the prophetic tattlers; or when it is summer, \nbut it is cloudy, and the stratocumuli, udder-shaped, grow, ripen \nabove the site—when and whether, and if, and wherever, and \nwhile—then, therefore, and consequently, it follows that no \none will notice the approach of the expedition, and even if one \nnotices, one will not caw, and if one does caw, one will not be \nheard, and if one is heard, there will be no response: Cozying \nup in the warm daze of kerosene, fearing polyps and glands, the \nbarracks will not meet her, will not look out. Only you, the apprentice-enchanter, pretending to be the admirer of the Celsius scale but actually evaluating the universe—more precisely, \none of its paths—every time you will discover them again on \ntheir way to the plywood dwelling. If the light dimmed, went \nout, the ne’er-do-wells would light the candle ends. You will \nsee them—poor, shaggy, and ugly; their features are revolting. \nHowever, when the procession came down from the railroad \nembankment, came closer to the gardens populated by stooping scarecrows, when it stepped on the solid ground of the yard \nflattened by children’s games and printing chicken feet, then \neverything achieved by the blabbermouths in the case of overcoming distances turned into purest fiction. Not thinking \nabout going back, not making even a step backward, the procession has already returned, transferred, moved to the starting position, toward the horizon, and clearly not noticing what \nhappened, continues what had been started—walks, marches, \ngoes forward, dragging and pushing, urging and scolding the \none whose head is thrown back and crowned with a quite \ntainted—but from afar, through the cleansing crystal of empty \nspace, astonishingly fresh ribbon. And when, many Aprils later, \none of the disobedient pupils of the courier institute will become an accidental witness of the Sisyphean gliding next to \nthe river-cesspool, it, despite all its particulars, will not seem to \nthe inspired youngster like a frightening revelation. He will \njuxtapose, compare both marches, and note their similar and \ndifferent features. Both of them—you will assure yourself, having turned with the help of the flannel into something resembling a cocoon and going to the official dormitory sleep—both \nof them are symptoms of terminal temporal disease that distorted the natural flow of events and years, the flow of being, \nthe course of the flow. And winter did visit—all in cheviot \ncoats and thaws. It came, feverishly breathing with the bowels \nof the bed table; it was a sum of smells—asidol, paste, wax, a \ndirt-cheap remedy, called without beating around the bushes a \nremedy against sores, soap, and, of course, Maria biscuits, sent \nby their namesake in a registered package. You would have preferred if winter wafted with Matthiola, you would have desired \nthe aroma of Hawaiian amalia, but you did not wince, did not \nturn away in disgust, fearing that it would get offended and \npass, while you wanted to remember it as well as possible—so \nthe next day, in spring, having left the cocoon before the bugle \nof reveille, you would offer the meeting to pencil and gouache. \nIt came and kept breathing. With an ashen mane, strange, and \nclinking with horseshoes made of ice. And to wake up in flowers \nand cicadas, under the camel-embroidered sheet that suddenly \nbecame too small. And to wake up in an Egyptian sarcophagus, \nin a hunting hideout made of tree branches, in the tower \nof Monsieur Flaubert, in the one in Pisa, in a hollow of a \nthousand-year-old baobab, having changed into a large longeared koala, hanging with its ears down. And to wake up meaning nothing, as a handful of ash from Tushino, firmly jammed \ninto a Tula mortar. Maria is leaving; it is dawn. To crack, to fry, \nand to eat three eggs. To feed the crumbs to two tweeting fugel. \nThey will finish pecking, clean their feathers, and tweet again. \nAnd other birds, beyond the window, were flying in the direction of the sun, and some were sitting on whitish branches, and \nothers still were trying to print on the roseate frozen sand, but \nunfortunately they were leaving no tracks. Looking askance at \nthe factory, at the smokes from distant plants, and at the laborer who, straining himself, pushed along the planks the overtime wagtail with junk, the celestial body was coming up. A \nVisit of the Ragpicker. The genre-painter-wanderer is not \nneeded and not known. The cook of an impoverished aristocrat is treating with some leftovers the suitor who dropped in \nfor an hour. They are having tea in the kitchen at the sticky table. The door to the backyard is partially open; a cart loaded \nwith noble junk can be seen there. Right beyond the backyard \nbegins the backdrop. Behind it, a drinking joint, a schlagbaum, \nverstas of blurry road, a jail, Siberia, and a cemetery are lined \nup. The visitor is poorly groomed, unbuttoned, with a face like \na trough; his visage bears traces of all kinds of excesses, while \nthe cook is by and large untidy, and her master, the emaciated \ngraying dotard, hiding for some reason in the larder and gingerly looking through his lorgnon at the laborer (the most \nfaded corner of the painting), having slightly pushed aside the \nfilthy curtain with his refined, long-fingered hand, her master—in a nightcap and some kind of cheap undergarment with \nfrayed lace of jabot and cuffs—is a total slob. And should we not \nwake up at his ancestral estate? In the library? On the ornate \nsettee? On the best days of its owner? As him in person? The \nworks of the departed overachievers may start glimmering in \nthe bookcases with the gold stamping of their spines, as soon \nas Selene, the brainless child of deaf and mute dusk, seemingly \nhaving swallowed itself and astonished and proud of it, Selene \nwith the features of a dictatorial idiot, gulps with her sardonic \nmouth, with the pores of her highborn face the darkness of the \nstudy, and the light may dominate, and everything that is able \nto reflect, mirror, shine, and glimmer—all this may glimmer, \nshine, mirror, and reflect. But then the stirring of poplars, the \nrustling of their meaty leaves may forecast the sudden morning, and the moon may already start fading and falling back, \ntumbling backward, like during an attack of epilepsy, rolling off \nthe roofs as a not-yet-eaten round bun, dropping behind them, \ndripping into the corrugated auricle, where big-cheeked pipers \npipe on Saturdays, plunging into the park of cultural recreation, into clusters of planted plane trees and the stirring \nlindens—rolling off, plunging, and spinning among them like \na Ferris wheel. The morning dawn dethroned, diminished the \nmoon; this way its fame was ending. The heavenly light penetrated your closed eyelids, and your face was soaring. But even \nin those moments of your youth, filled with lofty visions, you, \nthen a common apprentice courier, would not ever dare to assume that a time will come—and you will become a whipper-in. \nThe early brooms and the scratching of bread trays being taken \nout of the crates of the bread carriage, and the squeal of the \nsame trays, sliding diagonally into the underworld: the bread \nof someone’s early years. And someone of advanced years was \nwalking by. He was walking slowly. He was walking, afflicted by \nshortness of breath and by foul language. He was walking for a \nlong time. But even he passed by. And a while later the first \nelectric clunker escaped from the purple fingers of Aurora—it \nwas gliding over the rails, hissing with bearings and trolleys, \nand: But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, walks o’er the \ndew of yon high eastward hill—was posted on the route-board \nin hieroglyphics corresponding to the occasion. But the transport-absence of people did not last long: The coffeepot has not \nhad time to boil yet, when along the entire street the self-propelled and chock-full-filled equipages already started making \nnoise. The passengers’ appearance seemed disagreeable, like \nthe smell of the open, but as ill luck would have it, jammed \numbrellas, which from the frowning point of view so vividly \nresemble armpits of archaeopteryxes and which the provincials keep sticking in each other’s noses, having burst in, enthusiastically wet, at the stop named Theater, and having burst \nout, enthusiastically dry, after the premiere that opened another Aesopian season. Inconspicuous cricket of the outskirts, \nin October you are particularly mysterious. Sad-eyed, you listlessly soar as a patchy mist, walking quietly in the evening from \nthe swings, from the slipways, from the waves of motorboats, \ngray like the wet sailcloth. You appear, walk out, step on the \nyoung thistle before the highway, then—on the highway, \nthen—on the young thistle beyond it, on the cozy gully of Neglect, on beloved, hated—cross out what is not needed—fences \nand roofs, in order to dreamily, and blindly, and coolly mask it \nall, shield it, cover it, hide it from strangers’ beholding, swirling, \nwriggling, and writhing noiselessly, and as if you were squashed \nbetween five and six o’clock. You are shielding it, covering it, \nhiding it, and if one asks from what, you will not answer; perhaps you do not know the answer? No, you do know, but you \nwill not answer—and that is all. You will only answer someday, \nafter going through your youth, after grieving, after burning up, \nbut, as before, being envious of strangers in that old place, you \nwill answer to everything. Foolish girl, an orphan and a child of \norphans of this land, I am calling you—look back. Do you \nknow how bright and clean is your unwashed face and how \nmany earthly sorrows of your sisters are combined in its unearthly features? Lonely and lone among all the lone and lonely \nwho are countless, burn, burn brightly—there, at the cobblestone highway; here, at the crossroads of turnouts, and at the \ndead end, where the burdock grows. Burn with white light, sinless flower, burn, bitter, burn, timid, burn, enchanting. Burn for \nYakov, burn for everyone who is rushing to your light in confusion. From Saint George to the Intercession, from the river’s \nstanding to the river’s flowing and from the black fields to the \nwhite roads sheltering autumn—burn through the summer, \nburn through the winter, and as a white shepherd’s star spread \neverywhere gentle light, your secret charity. Be merry—your \nimage is perennial, not involved in anything, and out of this \nworld. There, on the cobblestone highway, here, on the crossroads of turnouts, burn incessantly in the circle of the funereal \nold women’s heads that resemble firebrands—gray and smoldering. On that cemetery or on that hill—show white from a \ndistance, burn rising up, captured by the army of crosses similar \nto warriors mounting brownish mounds. Come merry—to \nproclaim on the entire firmament your frenetic balabala. And \nthe dusks cometh and the dark flyers gather toward the night \ninto black flocks—and only the boundless spaces up high pay \nheed to this answer.\n",

  content: "Изморози — перейти. Курам — ходить по песку, удивленно печатая своими курьими ножками. Не любить этих птиц, но любить наблюдать, как печатают на мокром песке, не подозревая об этом; и ни \nо чем. Балаболки заслышались. Перекликались, но не аукались, ибо \nшли вместе, сплоченной стаей. Мойра, проводившая в палисаднике \nна скамейке свои перезрелые годы, тоже зачуяла голоса. Тогда она \nотложила спицы, которыми с утра ковыряла в ушах, привскочила, \nвсмотрелась в ту сторону и выкаркнула: ведут. Клубок серой шерсти скатился с ее колен, скакнул на клумбу и, сминая анемические \nханимуны, покатился куда-то клубком брачующихся гадюк. Баракам — ждать. Выступая в пространство апрельской прелести, говорили: ведут, накачалась. Сложному, смешанному духу самокруток \nи папирос государственного кручения витать над собранием интересующихся. Никого тут не знать. Неплательщик, бытующий в усеченной каморке под лестницей, был вне, ему — пропадать на хранилище вод, у эллингов, клянча фантики у бесстыжих гребчих. Мускулистые тренеры, люди среднего возраста, уничижали просителя. \nШла с распущенными, голову запрокинув, чтоб видеть сплошное \nсинее. Белое демисезонное, распахнутое. Но завтра пригреет — и уже \nв сарафане. А кикиморы — в черном. Шоссе фиолетовое, в лиловых \nлужах, и если еще о красках, о впечатлении, то вот — мелкая молодая листва, на фоне которой дается шествие, сообщает вам впечатленье зеленого дыма. Две смертельно костлявые — по́д руки. Прочие шли, охраняя, кольцом и все искали дотронуться. Уже давно, \nнесколько мгновений, замечал происходившее там, несколько лет \nзамечал все из окна. Впервые — когда-то, потом — то и знай, а затем — постоянно. Когда бы, куда бы ни: черная ликующая сороконожка, горбатая мокрица полуподвальная. Меняется время года \nи дня, длинные платья стаи меняются на долгополые балахоны. Меняются декорации, освещение, обувь статисток, но жесты, гримасы, \nпоходка — не обнаруживают варьяций. Когда октябрь и на черствый сухарь гудрона ложится топленое масло слякоти; поскольку \nтуман и по сточным канавам старушьих морщин сочится милдью, \nложно-мучнистая божья роса; если поздно, темно и осколки бутылочного стекла не блестят ни у пристани, ни в мусоре мусорных \nкуч; то ли январь ставит болтухам ветроснежные кляпы в их тощегубые рты; ниже февраль-кривотроп, снабдившись клещами вьюг, \nтщится вытащить вещим трещоткам их сухожилые языки; или же \nлето, но пасмурно, и растут, возрастают над местностью слоисто-кучевые, вымеобразные, — когда и поскольку, да если, да то ли, да \nили — тогда и постольку, и следовательно, стало быть, — никто не \nзаметит приближения экспедиции, а и заметит — не выкаркнет, \nа выкаркнет — не будет услышан, а будет — безрезультатно: ютясь \nв керосиновом теплом чаду, опасаясь полипов и гланд, бараки не \nвстретят, не выглянут. Лишь ты, начинающий лицедей, прикинувшись ревнителем цельсиевой шкалы, а в действительности оценивая мирозданье, точнее, один из его путей, всякий раз обнаружишь \nих снова на пути их к фанерной обители. Если свет помрачился, угас, \nзлыдни засветят свечные огарки. Бедных, косматых и некрасивых \nузришь ты; черты их истошны. Стоило шествию, впрочем, спуститься с насыпи, приблизиться к огородам, где сутулились пугала, ступить на убитую детскими играми и печатными курьими ножками \nдворовую твердь, как все достигнутое балаболками в деле преодоления расстояний оборачивалось фикцией чистейшей воды. Не помышляя вернуться, не отступив назад ни на шаг, шествие уже возвращено, сдвинуто, смещено на исходные рубежи, к горизонту, и, явно \nне замечая случившегося, продолжает однажды начатое — шествует, марширует, шагает, влача и толкая, понукая и поучая ту, чья голова запрокинута и увенчана столь несвежим, а издали — чрез очищающий кристалл пустоты — бантом поразительной свежести. И когда \nнемало апрелей спустя один из ослушников разъездного училища \nокажется невольным свидетелем сизифова скольжения при клоакереке, оно, со всеми его особенностями, не явится вдохновенному \nюноше пугающим откровением. Сопоставит, сравнит два марша, \nотметит их сходственные черты и различия. Превратившись при \nпомощи байки в подобье кокона: они оба, заверишь как-то себя, грядущего на казенный общежитейский сон, они оба — симптомы неизлечимого временно́го недуга, исказившего естественное теченье \nсобытий и лет, течение бытия, русло течения. И зима навестила — \nвся в шевиотах и оттепелях. Пришла, горячо дыша нутром прикроватной тумбочки; то была сумма запахов — асидол, паста, вакса, копеечное средство, названное безо всяких обиняков средством против потертостей, мыло и, разумеется, галеты Мария, присланные ею \nзаказной бандеролью. Ты предпочел бы зиму, веющую маттиолой, \nжелал бы аромата гавайской амалии, однако не морщился, не отворачивался неприязненно из опасения, что обидится и пройдет, а ты \nведь хотел получше запомнить ее — дабы на завтра, весной, оставив \nкокон до рога побудки, предать свидание карандашу и гуаши. Пришла и дышала. Пеплогривая, странная, цокающая ледяными подковами. И очнуться в цветах и цикадах, под одеялом с вышитыми \nверблюдами, которое вдруг стало мало. И очнуться в египетском \nсаркофаге, в охотничьем шалаше, в башне господина Флобера, в Пизанской, в дупле тысячелетнего баобаба, обернувшись большим большеухим коала, вниз ушами висящим. И очнуться в значении, равном нулю, в качестве тушинской пригоршни праха, туго забитой \nв тульский мортир. Мария уходит, рассвет. Разбить и поджарить \nи съесть три яйца. Крошками хлеба кормить свиристящих двух птах. \nСклюют и почистят перья и снова засвиристят. А другие птицы за \nстеклами летели в сторону солнца, а другие сидели на белесых ветвях, а четвертые пытались печатать на смерзшемся розоватом песке, \nно следов, к сожалению, не оставалось. Искоса глядя на фабрику, на \nдымы отдаленных заводов и на работника, что, страдая, катил по \nнастилам сверхурочную трясогузку с тряпьем, восходило светило. \nВизит тряпкореза. Жанрист-передвижник не нужен и неизвестен. \nКухарка разорившегося аристократа потчует чем-нибудь завалящим \nзаглянувшего на часок ухажера. Чаевничают на кухне за липким \nстолом. Двери на задний двор приоткрыты, видна тележка, груженная благородным старьем. Непосредственно за двором берут начало \nзадворки. За ними угадываются: кабак, шлагбаум, версты размытого тракта, острог, Сибирь и погост. Визитер неухожен, расхристан, \nкорытолиц, его обличье носит следы всевозможных излишеств; кухарка ж вообще нехалява, а барин ее, худосочный седеющий рамоли, отчего-то прячущийся в чулане и робко лорнирующий работника (самый жухлый угол живописи), слегка отведя изысканной \nдлиннопалой рукою замызганную занавеску, сам хозяин, в ночном колпаке и каком-то убогом, с обремканными кружевами жабо \nи манжет исподнем, — совершеннейший нехолюза. Да не очнуться ль \nв его родовом поместье? в библиотеке? на витиеватой козетке? в лучшие дни владельца? им же самим? Сочинениям честолюбцев покойных мерцать в шкапах золотыми тиснениями корешков, коль \nскоро Селене, безмозглому детищу глухонемого сумрака, будто бы \nпроглотившей себя и тем потрясенной и возгордившейся, Селене \nс чертами диктаторствующей идиотки — вбирать своим сардоническим ртом, по́рами своего высокосиятельствующего лица кабинетную темноту, и свету — преобладать, и всему, что способно отсвечивать, отражать, блестеть и поблескивать — всему тому поблескивать, \nблестеть, отражать и отсвечивать. Но вот шевелению тополей, шебуршению их мясистой листвы — предвестить скоропостижное утро, \nи луне начинать уже меркнуть и запрокидываться, закидываться, \nкак в припадке падучей, скатываться с крыш несъеденным колобком, закатываться за них, капать в гофрированную ушную раковину, куда дудят по субботам щекастые дудари, сваливаться в парк \nкультурного отдыха, в купы платных платанов и лип с их шевеленьем — скатываться, сваливаться и вертеться меж ними чертовым \nколесом. Заря развенчивала, умаляла луну; так проходила ее слава. \nСияние с неба проницало смеженные веки твои, и лицо твое реяло. \nНо даже и в эти, исполненные высоких прозрений мгновения младости ты, в то время обыкновенный стажирующийся разъездной, не \nосмелился бы и предположить, что настанет пора — и ты сделаешься \nдоезжачим. Первые метлы и скрежет хлебных лотков, изымаемых \nиз ячей хлебовозов, и визг тех же лотков, съезжающих в преисподнюю по наклонной: хлеб чьих-то ранних лет. А некто лет поздних \nшел мимо. Шел медленно. Шел, страдая одышкой и сквернословьем. Шел долго. Но миновал и он. А несколько погодя из пу́рпурных \nперст Авроры выскользнула первая электрическая колымага — \nскользила по рельсам, шипела подшипниками и троллеями, и: Вот \nи утро в мантии багряной ступает по росе восточных гор, — опубликовано было на маршрутной табличке приличествующими случаю \nиероглифами. Но транспортное безлюдье длилось недолго: кофейник еще не успел закипеть, а уже вдоль всей улицы самокатно шумели битком набитые экипажи. Вид пассажиров казался уныл, словно \nзапах раскрытых, заклинивших, как назло, зонтов, которые с точки \nзрения исподлобья так живо напоминают подмышки археоптериксов и которыми так и тычут друг другу в нос восторженно-сыро \nворвавшиеся на остановке Театр провинциалы после премьеры, открывшей очередной эзопов сезон. Неприметный сверчок окраин, \nв октябре ты особенно скрытен. Грустноглазый, вяло реешь клочковатою мгой, вечером тихо идя от качелей, от стапелей, от серых, как \nмокрая парусина, водно-моторных волн. Возникаешь, исходишь, находишь на: мелкий татарник перед шоссе, потом — на шоссе, на мелкий татарник за ним, на уютную балку Пренебрежения, на ненаглядные — ненавистные — ненужное зачеркнуть — палисады и кровли, \nчтоб и сонно, и слепо, и холодно заслонить это все, спрятать, сокрыть, утаить от чуждых свидетельств — клубясь, извиваясь и корчась раздавленно и бесшумно между пятью и шестью. Прячешь, \nскрываешь, таишь, а если спросить отчего — не ответишь; наверно, \nне знаешь ответа? нет, знаешь, но не ответишь — и только. Только \nответишь когда-нибудь, отъюношествовав, отгоревав, отгорев, но, \nкак и прежде, ревнуя ту давнюю местность к чужим на ней, ответишь за все. Неразумная девочка, сирота и дитя сирот этой земли, \nя зову тебя — оглянись. Ведаешь ли, как ясен и чист неумытый лик \nтвой и сколько земных печалей сестер твоих слилось в неземных \nчертах его. Одинокая и единственная из всех единственных и одиноких, коим числа несть, гори-гори ясно — там, на булыжном шоссе, здесь — на разъезжей росстани, и в тупике, где лопух. Гори белым цветом, безгрешным цветком, гори, горькая, гори, робкая, гори, \nзаветная. Гори для Якова, гори для всякого, смятенно спешащего на \nсвет твой. От Георгия до Покрова, от рекостава до рекоплава и от \nчерного поля до белых, осеняющих осень путей — гори вселетье, \nгори всезимье и белой пастушьей звездой твори повсюду свет кроткий, тайную милость твою. Радуйся — ни к чему не причастен извечный, нездешний твой образ. Там, на булыжном шоссе, здесь — на \nразъезжей росстани — гори негасимо в кругу погребальных старушьих голов-головешек — седых и чадящих. На том ли погосте, на \nтой ли горе — белей отдаленно, гори вознесенно, плененная воинством людоподобных крестов, бурые бугры оседлавших. Гряди, радуясь,— все-то небо оглашаешь ты кликушеским балабала́. И приидоша сумраки, и темные летуны к ночи совокупляются в черные \nстаи — и только выспренние пространства внемлют сему ответу.\n",

  content: "Bell-bottoms, a fleet cap with a crab, a pea coat \nwith anchors—what a picture. And he presents \nhimself—sailor Albatrosov, discharged without \nhands from the dry-cargo carrier to the ball of landlocked destiny; and what year did You launch from Your mother’s port? \nI also introduce myself. To our harbor, he says, ocean ships \nkept steerin, to drop anchor, I says, when their job was done, \nin the tavern, he says, merry sailors kept on cheerin, drinkin, \nI says, to the health of their valiant ataman. That’s all true, nodded the Black-fleeter, but for me you better touch upon love, \nadjust the music a little bit. Sure, even a hundred times. And I \noffer to the attention of the listener the cherished and sorrowful song. Chrysanthemums stopped bloomin long ago in the \npark, but despair’s still abloom in my own dear heart. My Albatros dipped his rudder, started clearin his throat, the dry cough \nis shakin the seaman. And just then comes a way station, and a \nUkrainian dawdler is peddlin mill cakes—periphery, outskirts. \nI jerked the door open and screamed: Hey, partner, do you \nneed teeth? ’Cuz I overspent durin my ride. Oh, I do, she says, \nI do, without them I’m at my wits’ end. I’m lettin both jaws \ngo for three rubles, just look how white—like a bone. I did let \nthem go and became a lisper again. It’s nothin, we’ll manage, \nfor the grateful chum we’d even give an eye for analysis. The express moved forward and we moved to its restaurant: Munch to \nstop the hunger’s rage, take your meds from early age. We captured by abordage two reserved seats and ordered everythin \ndelightful—even the fish sticks. And he reports: You have upset my livers with them chrysanthemums, I’m a son of a witch, \nwhen I was a novice sailor, I was based on the trainin pontoon, \non a cracked barge, and I did not even have a chance to blink, \nwhen on the park’s bald spots with all kinds of carousels began \nto loom, he says, a foolhardy mamuasel—a gal not too appealin \nbut always willin. At first I used to hang out with her alone, \nbut later I would bring those mates who did not have to stand \nwatch, and it was exactly she who was tormented by this song. \nAnd when we were raisin the anchors, I got away for an hour \nfrom all hands on deck—and to the girl. For farewell she gives \nme a piece of paper: She wrote down all the stanzas and put the \naddress on the back—the lane, the buildin, and the room. As \nif to say: Don’t forget, send snapshots. But durin a campaign \nthere ain’t much to write about, and it’s forbidden too, and \nlater we all got placed into school’s custody, and there we’re \neven less into letters, a complete rat race: either the solitary \nconfinement, or scrubbin, or crammin the Morse, and with cadets there are scrapes ’cuz of hussies—it’s no joke. No, seafarin \nsoul, mine did not leave any address, just left God only knows \nwhere, and now try to claim damages. We tasted misfortune \nwith her, lived together in her pad quite a while, but did not \nstockpile nothin except Yakov—a smartie but, nevertheless, \na dummy, and even then she hinted that not I am his happy \nfather, from a switchman, supposedly, she got like that, ’cuz \nshe was servin at the switch, and in the beginnin was on duty \nround the clock. Where and how, I tried to learn, at what hour? \nWell, she esplains, on a pile of discarded wood chips, next to \nthe storeroom, where they used to eat suppers. Suppers or not \nsuppers, who’s gonna check, but I was troubled a lot. Orya was \ncuttin me without a knife, but altogether, I underline, it was \nbearable, and it only turned unbearable when she advanced to \na dispecher there and started actin as tactlessly as can be. A hair \npick like any other, and yours, made of tortoiseshell, I lost on \nthe rails. Well, and this one here, how on earth?—I was askin, \nfeelin completely cheated but not ready for a clash. She kept \ngivin me runarounds, insolent to the max—I found it on the \nrails too. Your vale is like the railroad, came to my mind, but \nyou yourself—you’re a slutty broad, you ain’t mine, your most \nstrongest friendship ain’t with me, not in this here hovel, not \non this here reclinin device, but on those same rails; they even \nmanaged to make you Yashka on the ties. I started wondrin.\n\nAnd the dawn, I’ll say frankly, is catchin fire stronger than any \ndawn on the other side of the Wolf, although You, most likely, \ncan hardly understand what we, the inhabitants, call Beyond \nthe Wolf. That’s why I am rowin, a water strider, to the other \nshore. Briskly-briskly I row, sprightly-sprightly, and the masts \nare bendin and they creak, but the Itil outdid my brisk pace \nwith its width, and the day midges are already at the heels of \nthe swarms of mornin moskitos. I reach it before lunch, and \nmy scull like a fish jumps out on the sand at full speed. I celebrated my achievement with Your second smoke and I’m hobblin along on my squeakers, observin the growth of lilies. I \nconfirm: They toil not, they spin not, and yet they’re dressed \nspic-and-span. But skimmin thru these here sketches of mine, \nYou have the right to exclaim in protest. I am sensin Your puzzlement, I’m not a knucklehead, even if I’m disfigured, but let’s \nagree once and forever: Crutches are crutches, but mushrooms—\nnuts. And I cannot, due to the first, whilst they ain’t present, \nand havin abandoned the trips for the third and the second, sit \nlike my namesake from Murom without stirrin for thirty years \nplus three more of travel restrictions. Thank goodness, Krylobyl visited me and, feelin sympathy, enlightened. Ilya Petrikeich, he declares cleverly, do you insist that the time fuctions \neverywhere in unison? I said: I do not insist. I have nothin to \nhide, Sidor Fatherovich; when I insist, then I do insist, \nbut if I don’t—then right away: I don’t insist and that’s it, \nwhy drag it on. And I told him squarely: You may be offended, \ncomplain, you have the right, but I am givin you my word: Yes, \nI do not insist. Look, Krylobyl, this know-it-all, instructs, let’s \ntake not time, but an ordinary river. Well, let’s. And turn your \nimagination, he pesters, that it practically doesn’t move in the \nbackwater; duckweed and grasses are stranglin it, while at the \nchannel line it rushes; and the time fuctions the same way, he \nesplained, in Gorodnishche it moves, approximately, like a \nstroke of a swift’s wing, in Bydogoshch, not too fast and not \ntoo slow, and in the woods, a total peace and quiet. For that \nreason, mind my assurances that the theft, of which you are the \nvictim, took place so far only in our beloved town and nowhere \nelse, and on the other side nobody even heard about it. That \nmeans, if you move over there—everythin will be right again. I \ntook all this under consideration and started goin on the future \nscow to bygone years. The main difficulty—how to get to the \nmoorin posts. Regardless of graphs and paragraphs, around \nhere there was and still is a severe shortage of volunteers to assist the defectives, that’s why we are the chosen ones. And for \nthat reason, in adventures of the given kind, I, a good chap, am \naided only by the familiar to You thrice-removed relatives. I \nhave rowed across and hobble aimlessly, havin trampled lameness with lameness, and You—here, in the present—are \nstudyin this Volapuke. You’ve gone up on the porch to get \nsome air and turned Your imagination to me; You shield your \neyes: Our scamp has a finger in every pie—I see the grinder \nBeyond the Wolf. No, I see You there, ’cuz not I am there but \nYou. In a word, we both are right. After all, since we are on different sides, we also have a different geography: You are Beyond the Wolf and I am too. Well, so she misplaced her attention to the tot, returns tanked up, and I—I’m a scandal-maker. \nAnd one day Orina tells me straight on: Say, let’s divide our \ntoys in half. Ilya has nothin to divide, all his toys from the belongins kind, of plates-foot-bindins type—are one or two and \nhe’s ready to go. I loaded the ammunition into my indestructible snatch-it-all, into a sack, bowed to the cheater, kissed sonny, \nprobably not my own, rolled down the banisters to the basement, and opened under the stairs a kind of a fur-makin workshop, I became a sort of a chillin furrier. But actually I was \nmakin a livin by paintin and sellin various inflatable balloons \nfrom a pharmacy and inventin squeak-squaks. There’s no doubt \nthat I slept there too, and slightly later, to avoid tiffs with the \npowers that be, obtained a patent. How the heck—it’s on the \nbottom of the list now—but I gathered as many orders as cat’s \ntears, so I was forced to beg on local trains and make repairs to \nthis or that old thing; I also became a whiz on a few instruments. Or somethin else—one may wander now and then at \ndawn to the dump—one may look, but I’m just a spook, a fidgety bum. Widely and freely, I dare to mention, spread these \nmalodorous fields; occasionally, you’ll go far-far in search of \njoys—and you’ll get lost. When you’re workin hard, everythin \ndrags by imperceptibly; it’s already noon, and if not the frosty \nsparks, then skylarks. You’ll ascend the garbage mound to get \nsome rest—your spirit will flare up: A tip-top site! Look \naround: In the west, in the valley, the ragpicker scrapes the garbage with her rake; in the north, a three-pawed bitch scours for \nsome grub; in the east, a sergeant-reservist rummages in the \nstream—raves about assemblin a motorcycle out of spare \nparts; and in the south, some riffraff scavenges for cigarette \nbutts. Peace, calm, nobody’s doin nothin to nobody, ’cuz here a \nman is a man to man, nothin more; and the smokes of the \nfatherland are everywhere, like durin that uprisin—garbage \nsmolders softly, a real panorama wherever you’d turn your \nhead. And such closeness to it pinches inside, that to return \nhome—to hell with it! Our inhabitant is attracted to the expanses of his land and he needs nothin else. In those same \nquarters I put together a decent lidrary, so to speak, that is, a \ncollection of multicolored tops from various mixtures: colognes, perfumes, You know what. In this sense, invaluable help \nby her advices and greetins used to gimme that western ragpicker, auntie with meat on her bones, well-bred and with experience, and she was sixty-plus years old—a delicacy, no \nmore no less. It’s an adventure from the past, and I will not hide \nwhat was: I had a fleetin crush on her, as also happened, incidently, with her grand-ward, or similar to it, for which, of \ncourse, in retrospect, I blame myself, if that’s required. Ladies’ \nflesh is a great temptation; that certain thing—we yearn for it \nbut can’t be held accountable. The same here: Everythin started \nalmost like when you just fool around. She kept objectin, \navoided me, frowned, but if you dig more deeply—there’s no \ndifference. In the barracks they used to say that she’s nuts, she’s \nlike that from birth, but personally I wouldn’t claim nothin exceptional. The only thing that her head was really rather absurdly small, but the ragpicker assured—it’ll ripen to the weddin, it will heal; well, if it’ll ripen, it’ll ripen, the caretaker \nknows better. One day she sends her girlie with some hide for \nme to scrape—and I got excited in my declinin fate. Only don’t \nlook for faults, Fomich, in the beginnin I curbed my curiosity, \nwhat things are like with her, that is, at her age, You know, well, \nso accidently I put the bolt in the lock, in secret, that is, from \nmyself. Later I reckon—devil has his ways—I’ll take a gamble, \nnot everythin is done by calculation, like with grandmas, it \nwould be nice with their grandkids every now and then, spontaneously. And the incorrigible happened, I deployed myself \nwith the adolescent in excitement and at the heat of the moment. We agreed to meet; sometimes we please each other under the stairs, other times under the bowroat. After several \nmonths, on the side, from a friendly guitarist, to whom I am \neternally grateful for teachin me how to read music, I learn that \nsome rivermen secretly cleave my teenager. I turned a blind \neye—she’s not made of soap, she won’t foam away, and they’re \ndoin what the young do, that’s their right—they’ll cleave and \nleave. Orina worried me, her contacts led me off the rails, and \nfeelin lonely without her, I grieved under the scow, crawlin on \nthe rags that should be burned so they won’t stink. And the \nticklin trash like flies fed on the junk and made its habit to \nwalk over the exposed places. At first they didn’t bother me; \non the contrary, I derived some pleasure from them, but closer \nto the Assumption they ate me alive, and my encouragement \nended. And in the hole of the rowlock there lived a wolf spider. The entire bottom, like heavens above, he entwined with \nhis web. I kept catchin the insects and throwin them into his \nnets. How neatly he, unscrupulous, kept takin out the souls of \nthese creatures, yikes! Pasha, my comin, my Spider, wrote Pyotr to his nephew from the village, I haven’t seen an event \nmore borin than January without yeast, so bring it hook or \ncrook. In my heart I believe, he continued, in my heart I know \nyou won’t lemme down, but the mind is weak, gets tempted: \nYou will not bring it, after all; woe is us, tipplers, in that case. \nPrecisely then, Pavel sends me the news by the Fenist. Ilyusha, \nsir, our prophet, I and Pyotr here got into our heads to stockpile some home brew, and ’cuz you wish us well even without \nthat, and helped us with the letter zhe, won’t you loan us, \nbesides that, some money, as I will liken the yeast Beyond the \nWolf to everythin marvles, and winter without it I will compare \nto spring without top boots, or to the same winter but without \nvalenki; like a dreadful nightmare, he exploits, will be the \nflutterin above us, apostles, so please. I procured some paper, \nsand, dipped the pen into the inkwell and started gazin with \nadmiration outside, where the lonesome snowbabe, sculpted \nby me, broke into a serious drip. On the calendar—the end of \nthe side-warmer, but wait a bit with grinnin, March may still \nforce you to sell your last shirt. Stop sendin the Fenist in vain, \nI answered Pavel, you and your uncle won’t get money from \nIlya, so far I’m not dispensin money but healins, and these \nonly to those that show respect, and even more not to be guzzled away: ’Nuf of gettin pickled; but before I, maybe, send \nyou money, before that, you’ll deliver to me by a courier my \naccessories. Which? Well, those that you and the saints like \nyou filched in December, havin chosen for this the confusion \nof darkness and the hubbub of the blizzie. And I passed on to \nthe whipper-in the ultimat to take care of and solve our discord in secrecy, without proclaimin it from the housetops, by \nagreein that neither the wolf nor the hound, but somehow \nneither this nor that, somethin like the mornin evenin, and \nthat I, bein amenable, would hope for the return of one instead of two. And the reply: Wipe clean, he offends, your bodily beacons and watch out so you won’t get tossed accidentally \ninto the outside darkness. And then I decided to undertake \nthis here supplication to You, and to forget the Spider and his \nrequest, havin punished him with a chill rebuff. What’s been \nsaid—we will do, but let’s not forget—or else the night will \nremind us—how with his trunk he kept takin out the souls of \nthe flies under the boat.\n\nAnd I started wondrin. Orya, my Orya, they also kept chafin \nyou all over the hollows in the same manner. On weekdays of \nthe paycheck or on Fridays of the advance, in the famed alders beyond the tracks, unknown to me trainees, your darin \nbuddies from railroad vocational schools, were audaciously \ncarousin with you. You are quite weak, Orina Ignatyevna, as \nit became clear, between Your legs, You ain’t indifferent to \nsweets, and not a hair pick You’ve lost on the rails but honor. \nFor a faceted tumbler of the poison from Kashin you caressed \nthem every which way, you wanton shrew. Why, I would quietly wanna find out, you never fondled Ilya like that? And a \ncertain bush grew over there, inconspicuous, but thick and \nclose by, and durin lengthy twilights I observed indecencies \nfrom there; You were a Sodomite, little mother. Afterward I \nwould go to the nutty one, tryin to recoup my losses, but with \nher—like with a doll—she would look at me as if she was \nmade of lead, not indulgin me in any whim. On the weekday \nof railroad paycheck or on Friday of the advance, I knocked \nback a few on account of someone’s generosity, picked up a \npiece of iron by the depot, and I’m waitin in the famous alders \nbeyond the tracks. And these rascals, shorties sixteen boyish \nyears old, appear and lead my workin girl on the execution \nmeadow of love. I decided to wait—let them begin; then, filled \nwith more courage, I will attack from behind the kurgan like a \nperfidious infidel. Quickly, five of them got pickled and started \ndoin what each was good at. Eh, I think, ready or not, here I \ncome. But then I reckon: If you rush the stuff you will make \nthem laugh, you’ll scare them inadvertently; I better hold my \nfire. And from nothin to do I keep rereadin a ticket that I also \npicked up, with a number, truly, 8,420 to be exact, suitable for \ntravel last year to such an unforgettable land as the Meadow \nSaturday. This cardboard piece affected Ilya, affected him a \ngreat deal. Just imagine, Fomich, the Meadow Saturday. That \nis, not only Saturday but in addition framed by meadows, perhaps even water ones. And streams of concertina are splashin \nover them. And the weekenders, in ironed clothes, and even \nwith canes, keep strollin, beamin about somethin appropriate. Everythin is calm, no mug-thrashin, only the coachmen \nswear at water carriers, but even that with yawns. And if they \ndecide to sit for a while in the shadow with company—retire, \ngentlemen, into the bushes, to special stands, and relax to your \nhealth. I pictured for myself this bliss, so unlike our places, and \nI make a commitment: Whatever happens, regardless of any \nscrapes or anythin else—to pay Meadow Saturday a visit in \nthe future existence. And I tied a knot. On my necktie. And \nwhen together with the sailor Albatrosov we whistled ourselves all hands on deck, havin abruptly abandoned the buffet \ncar ’cuz our funds ran out, and we moved to the foksel, our \nsteamboat was dockin at the proper embarcadero. We disembarked, looked around, and lingered in that hole a couple of \nweeks—what boonies and wastes! With no money and desperate, we hanged around there like jerboas, and havin conversations with the locals, we were talkin to them, sayin: And \nyou dare to call yourself Meadow Saturday. We scrounged half \na ruble for smokes and followin the dictates of our hearts plodded down to Gorodnishche to have some fun and, after arrivin, \nwe inquire: How’s that young life of yours? So-so, they answer, \nwe’re gettin by little by little. And how are you managin with \nchasers? Well, we almost always manage to fill our stomachs \nwith some innards. So after our arrival, we got to be there, and \nhavin a surplus of ailments, started hangin about. On the day \nof railroad paycheck or the day of the advance, I’ve had a gulp \nin the joint near the station with rail workers-tipplers—and I \nstand jealous in the bush with the danglin iron. How I jumped \nout, how I leaped out with the hatchet: Aha, I threaten them, \naha! And they: Grab him, grab him! Brace yourself, they \nyell, such-and-such jerk! Four of them caught up with me \nand knocked me down as I fled. And they kept stompin on \nme, askin: How about that, did we catch you fair and square, \nyou mother-sucker? You did catch me, I cry, cap-bands, you \nbanged me up, hammers in button loops, as fair and square as \ncan be. I try to break free—but they hold fast. They pounded \nme like Sidor’s goat, got me filthy all over and—I see—they \nare draggin me, the poor wretch, along the gray slag with my \nmug down. And they’ve pulled me up the embankment, spiders, and, relentless, are clampin me to the rail with barbed \nwire. Why do it, kiddos, I agonized, am I some kind of a fox \ncub to you? Tenacious, with their crafty mitts they completely \nsquash me on the stinky ties, deviously don’t lemme breathe. \nThey had fastened me like a valenok to the speed skate— \ncrosswise and leavin no slack, with linesman’s pliers, and then \nthey split, chickens. I’m also scared—I’m waitin for the express. And—as it is customary—I started refreshin my past: \nHow did I live this time, decently or not? I reckoned this and \nthat, and the characteristic turned out mostly not bad. I had the \nreputation of a serious, respectable gentleman, had not committed, as they say, highway robbery. And when the embers of \nthe heavenly matters were already pourin down from above, \nthen, in spite of everythin, this strange Orya appeared to help. \nShe kept callin the obnoxious Ilya a poor fox, started to unwind the wires—and was shakin like a leaf. And I felt with \nmy whole shoulder blades that my express is comin close, \nand the wires are many and thick. It had but a few meters left, \nit was humiliatin with its lanterns, made noise. I said: Orya, \nsweetie, so long, step aside. And she: And maybe together? \nNot with me, I negate, you stick with the cap-bands. And she: \nDon’t be cross about that, with them urchins I just so—to \nhave a little fun, to visit for a while—but my joy was bein with \nyou, I felt with you like earth with grass, she says, and forget \nmy excesses—everythin passed, healed, sharp teeth, long tail. \nYou have mixed it up, little mother, you’re confusin somethin, \nseriously, do I take after a fox? The magpie is sick, she claims, \nthe crow is sick too, she says, and Ilya is healthy and glad, she \ncasts the spell. I jerked, jerked, pulled, but partially did not \nsucceed. It swooped, mangled, hot, and my hands-legs scattered all over. The battalion of about-goners grew larger; commander, receive the reinforcements. And the infirmary. Havin \nnot found this and that in the makeup of my body, I came to a \nboil and demanded consolation. A hulk of a doc in a cap floats \nin. To my question, Where is my friend?—he says the miserly: \nShe’s done for. To the bonesetter: Go, heal Thyself, I permit \nmyself not to believe You—just look what You’ve thought up; \nI made a row. And my treatment went on. There were newspapers, slippers, shavin was provided.\n\nAnd I recalled how, braggin about his sharpened blades, Gury \nkept tootin his horn among the masters in the co-op that so far \nhe missed the sad chore of racin races against the whipper-in; \nI’ll blow by, he claimed, as if he was standin in place. As a result, they started arguin, put wine in the kitty. Havin received \nthe notification-declaration, the whipper-in approves. They \nagreed to run as usual, in the dark, and, possessin the mental \nhypervision, I see them like now—one in clothes patched, the \nother in mismatched. At the takeoff, they clawed nose by nose, \nand they aspired to run almost exactly from the pant-washin \ndeck to the Sloboda tributary, to the Tavern Island number \ntwo—and back. And they rushed along, cuttin the ice with \ntheir skates. The whirlin snow dusted the tracks of their heroic \ndeed, and the fishes not as much saw the athletes as heard them, \nbut in the near future perhaps they’ll have a chance to taste one \nof the participants; come and pray, large and small fishie. A few \nverstas before the turn, Gury began gainin and the whipper-in \nfallin behind, but Gury aimed slightly more to the right than he \nshould and fell into a polynya, an ice hole in the area of the fairway. It does not freeze there under any conditions, and quite a \nnumber of sleepyhead coachmen and lunatic speed skaters fell \nin over there. They failed to account for Gury too; he plopped \nin and right away got sucked under the ice, so the dog master on his part just started sobbin. They decided to hold the \nwake for the wolf-slayer without his factual presence; nobody \nwas in the mood to wait until he floats up somewhere or until \nthe kiddos pull him out with a dragnet: In most of their cases \nour folks embrace the lack of time. And so they gathered at the \ngravedigger’s. You know Beyond the Itil, here it’s impossible \nto put an end, even if relative, to quarrels and disputes: They \nstarted arguin about love—say, who she is, that thoroughly \nbeautiful madame. Everyone stuck to his guns; one, like Vasily \nKaraban, that Everlastin Existens dropped in to visit, the \nother—on the contrary: discords, bad harvest, events. And I, \nstayin pas, don’t butt in, keep neutral. But to You—to You I \nadmit, obviously not to tell the others, since even without that \nthey consider Ilya a chucklehead. Why, what on earth for did \nshe persuade the medical four-eyes to powder my brains—I \ncan’t make sense of it. And now she’s remorseful, searches \nalong the entire river, ain’t there among you the one, you know, \nwho. They are lyin that no, as they themselves are head over \nheels in love: We don’t know who you are concerned about, \nbut all of us wouldn’t mind bein with you. And Gury’s also like \nthem, even though he’s a Chud. Oh my precious, he pleaded, \nour reach ain’t narrow—it’s wide, and where this youngster is \nnestin, I have no clue, I only realize that if you popped in to \nmy place for a short while, then the road of my life, narrow as \na sharpened blade, would become as wide as this reach. She \nstayed, they say, with him for a while on the eve of his decisive \nheat with the head dog master, but even that was more than \nthe supplicant could handle. I am worried: She is my intended \ndemise, and she, Orya, is lookin for me, Fomich, pinin. And I \ndon’t know what measures to undertake—to get lost without \na trace or to hobble to her with a confession. But neither this \nnor that is possible right now. Krylobyl—that’s whom I trust, \nwhom I praise—Krylobyl admonished the wardens: You, light \nof your own eyes, return to the cripple what’s the cripple’s. \nThey started scurryin, but the sought for completely vanished. \nPerhaps it was drunk away, perhaps thrown behind a bush of \nbrittle willow, perhaps it simply floated down the stream. But \nfor Ilya it makes no difference, put it back where you took \nit, Ilya needs it here and now. He got stuck, he got stuck for \ngood without them. Some have Sloboda, some Overbrowears, \nsome Gorodnishche, but he—he is sittin here like a dog on \nvomit. Just look, as long as we’re talkin about it, how many of \nthem hold a watch in a circle around our establishment. Do \nYou think they are waitin for alms? No way, there’s nothin they \ncould hope for, so far they didn’t earn it. No, not for alms—\nthey’re waitin for those who celebrate their promotions. And \nas soon as you promptly get outta there, these doggish mutts \nbegin to swallow their frozen turds and show their tongues. \nTheir calculations are simple: Probably, lookin at these revoltin \nthings, or simply due to the fresh air, you’ll serve them ten-kopeck macaroni à la fleet. And if you get stingy—a more noble \nregular will split his sides. And the droolers will run up and \nsnarf everythin. And they get drunk right away, and at once \nengage in marriages-weddins, right in public, and as a result, \nthey give birth to such mongrels that better don’t let anybody \nsee them. They get born, get stronger, and, like their granddads and moms—along the beaten track, with their famous \nside-amble—march, march to the sickler. Halloo, the chain of \nthese generations ain’t breakin here, it rings, clanks, and the \nsnack bar, standin in full view, doesn’t disappear from our eyes. \nWe’re all mankind’s brood, my dear, and we’re no strangers to \nknockin down a shot. Now consider truthfully my position, \nhow can Ilya get his body goin, not to mention the more secret things. My companion escorts me to the bench near the \ngate—and I’m sittin, enfeebled, under the pines, temptin my \nfemale neybors. Hark! A snowcap fell on my forhead; stop it, \nwoodpecker, watch out, hoopoe, you’ll get what you’ve been \naskin for. They pulled, they pulled the wool over Ilya’s eyes, he \nfound himself cast aside, and the public makes fun of his Saturdays. Here they are, Discords Beyond the Itil as such, Fomich, \nand we cannot wait to taste the nonexistence. But do me a favor, don’t worry: We’ll get milled over—and back. Everythin \nhad already happened on the Itil, all the folks had already been \nthere before. Let’s say, somebody appears, and they call him: \nHey, feller wanderer, will you have some? But the comer cuts \nthem short: You took me for someone else, I’m yours, homegrown, you simply forgot about me, so just pour. I also claim—\nDzhinzherela kicked his heels about, settled here and there, \nhappened to visit the Wolf River, drank the vino, sharpened the \nunsharpened, caressed lonesome babes, and went, whenever \nhe needed, for seasonal work into the wild blue yonder. Hence, \nI am smart like, approximately, Krylobyl. He remarks with insistence: Everythin around is drunkenness, everyone comes \ndrunk and leaves drunk, and the river just flows and flows, and \nshe don’t give a hoot about nothin. I agree, but lemme be more \nprecise: They come drunk and sit, never leavin the crashbaret, \nand she flows, but the shores remain. And on the shores we’re \nnestin—and our life is eternal. But I chatted with You too long, \nI’ve got to hit the sack. If You need anythin, wander in to have \nsome tea; don’t be shy—we’ll do some tea-drinkin, tea-sippin. \nAt the same time I dare to bother You about the followin: Do \nYou have any spare candy wrappers? I’m a fan, I possess a passion for collectin. Bring them as they are, along with the candy. \nAnd salt, matches, and other necessities are constantly with us. \nAnd for the bad writin You will, undoubtedly, excuse me, I was \ncomposin in a considerable haste, and I also took a little bit \nof medicine thanks to my merciful hostess. And the signature, \nif I may. And those who are illiterate—a cross. Listen, where \nin the world did I find such a last name, where did I snag it? \nMaybe I’m a Gypsy baron or maybe the wind simply blew it \nin. Whatever’s the case, somehow I have to set on paper the \nabovementioned. And pour some sand on it. All the most exceptional to You.\n",

  content: "Клеши, мичманка с  крабом, бушлат в  якорях  — картинка. \nИ представляется: матрос Альбатросов, списан без рук с сухогруза \nна бал сухопутной участи; а сам-то с которого года? Рекомендуюсь \nи я. В нашу гавань, говорит, заходили корабли, большие, говорю, \nкорабли из океана, в таверне, говорит, веселились моряки и пили, \nговорю, за здоровье атамана. Все это так, черноморец сказал, но коснись-ка ты мне за любовь, перетряхни чуток музыку. Хоть сто раз. \nИ предлагаю вниманию слушателя песнь заветную, жалостную. Отцвели во саду хризантемы давно, а тоска все цветет в моем сердце \nродном. Свесил румпель на квинту мой Альбатрос, запершил, кашель сухой морехода бьет. А как раз полустанок, и рохля хохлатская жмыхами торгует — периферия, окраина. Дверь рванул и ору: \nтоварка, тоби зуби трэба? а то поиздержался в пути. Ой, трэба, трэба, бэз ных зажурылась. Уступлю за трояк обе челюсти, подывысь, \nяки били — як кисть. Уступил и сделался шепелявым сызнова. Ерунда, перебьемся, для благодарного закадыки и глаз на анализ. Скорый дальше — а мы в его ресторацию: кушай с голоду, лечись смолоду. Оккупировали на абордаж два посадочных и приказали всего \nвосхитительного — до головизны вплоть. И докладывает. Огорчил \nты печенки мне хризантемами этими, щукой быть, ведь салагой базировал я на учебном плашкоуте, на утлой баржé, и не успел очухаться, как на плешатине парка со всякими каруселями замаячила, \nговорит, отчаянная мамзель — пацанка смурная, но безотказная. \nПоначалу один с ней цацкался, а потом корешей свободных от вахт \nприхватывал, и как раз она все песенкой этой мучилась. И когда \nс якорей снимались, я от аврала оторвался на час — и к девочке. На \nпрощанье сует листок: все куплеты списала и адрес на обороте — \nпереулок, строенье и комната. Дескать, не забывай, шли фоточки. \nНо в походе писать особенно не о чем, да и запрещено, а после нас \nвсех в училище на поруки приняли, а уж там тем более не до писем, \nвремени — полный обрез: то губа, то приборка, то переборки зубришь, а то с кадетами из-за шмар номера — кроме шуток. Нет, морская душа, моя адреса не оставила, уехала просто неизвестно куда, \nи попробуй взыщи. Пробедовали мы с ней, прожительствовали \nв хавере ее весьма основательно, но не нажили ничего, кроме Якова — умненького, а все-таки дурачка, да и то — намекала, что не я его \nсчастливый отец, от стрелочника залетела якобы, потому что при \nстрелке она состояла, сутками дежурила на первых порах. Где и как, \nдознавался, в котором часу? Да на куче дресвы подсыпной, выясняется, у подсобки, где ужинали. Ужинали не ужинали, поди проверь, \nно я горюнился сильно. Резала Оря меня без ножа, но было, подчеркиваю, втерпеж, а невтерпеж наступило, когда перешла в диспетчеры, где бестактничала вообще беспримерно. Гребень как гребень, \nа твой, черепаховый, на путях утеряла. Спрашивал, сплошь обманутый, не решаясь на схлест, — ну а этот-то с каких барышей? Отбояривалась, вся наглая, — его на путях же нашла. Юдоль твоя путевая, \nмыслилось, сама же ты — непутевая, не моя, не со мною твоя главнеющая приязнь, не в этой вот конуре, не на этой лежачей возможности, а на все тех же путях, даже Яшку тебе на шпалах сварганили. \nЯ задумался.\n\nА заря, скажу откровенно, занимается в зеркале похлеще любой \nзаволческой, хотя Вам, наверное, малопонятно, что́ мы, которые \n население, Заволчьем зовем. Почему и гребу, водомер, на ту сторону. \nРезко-резко гребу, споро-споро, и мачты гнутся и скрипят, но Итиль \nширотою превысила спорость мою, и тощанка дневная утреннему \nкомариному толкуну на ходу подметки срезает. Достигаю к обеду, \nи ялик рыбкой с размаху выбрасывается на песок. Перекурил достижение дукатиной Вашей второй и тащусь на скрипучих вдоль, \nнаблюдая, как лилеи растут. Подтверждаю: не трудятся, не прядут, \nно одеты с иголочки. Но, пробегая мои настоящие очерки, Вы вправе воскликнуть протест. Недоуменье улавливаю, не дышлом кроен, \nхоть гондрыбат, но давайте условимся раз навсегда: костыли — костылями, грибы — орехами. Не могу же я из-за первых, по мере их \nнеприсутствия, тридцать лет, как тезка из Мурома, сиднем сидеть, \nоставив поездки по третьи и по вторые да три по рогам. Слава богу, \nнавестил меня Крылобыл и, соболезнуя, надоумил. Илия, мудрит, \nПетрикеич, настаиваешь, время единовременно, что ли, повсеместно \nфукцирует? Я сказал: я не настаиваю. Мне таить, Сидор Батькович, \nнечего; если настаиваю — то настаиваю, а нет — то сразу: не настаиваю, и баста, зачем темнить. И я прямо ему сказал: можешь обижаться, серчать, твое право, но вот тебе мое слово: ну не настаиваю. Смотри, Крылобыл, этот умняга, учит, давай с тобой не время возьмем, \nа воду обычную. А давай. И останови впечатление, тормошит, в заводи она практически не идет, ее ряска душит, трава, а на стрежне — \nстремглав; так и время фукцирует, объяснял, в Городнище шустрит, \nмахом крыла стрижа приблизительно, в Быдогоще — ни шатко ни \nвалко, в лесах — совсем тишь да гладь. Потому и пойми уверенье, \nчто кража, которой ты — жертва, случилась пока что лишь в нашем \nлюбимом городе, и больше нигде, и на той стороне о ней и не слыхивали. Стоит, значит, тебе туда переехать — все ходом и образуется. Принял я это к сведению и заездил на будущем челноке в позапрошлое. Главная сложность — добраться до причальных колов. \nНесмотря на графы, параграфы волонтеров ущербным способствовать, недостаток у нас остреющий был и будет, на то мы и избраны. \nПосему в похождениях известного толка мне, дяде, соучаствуют \nзнакомые Вам троюродные плетни. Перегреб и тащусь вдоль кромки Лазаря наобум, хромотой хромоту поправ, Вы же — здесь, в настоящем периоде, изучаете сей волапюк. Поднялись на терраску \nпроветриться и обратили воображение на меня: наш пострел-то, \nзаститесь, всюду поспел — в Заволчье точильщика зрю. Нет, это \nя Вас там вижу, ибо не я там, а Вы. Словом, оба мы правы. Ведь \nпоскольку на разных мы сторонах, то и различная у нас география: \nВы за Волчьей и я же. Ну и вот, дитя вниманьем забросила, возвращается выпитая, а я — скандалист. И однажды Орина мне напрямик, что давай-ка игрушки мы пополам. Илье делить было нечего, \nего всех игрушек из рода скарба типа тарелок-портянок — раз-два \nи умылся. Поместил амуницию во влагалище неветшающее, в мешок, поклонился изменнице, сынулю нерóдного, вероятно, поцеловал, съехал по перилам на нулевой этаж и открыл под лестницей \nкак бы скорняжный цех, как бы прохладным заделался скорняком. \nНа поверку же промышлял крашением и сбытом надувных аптечных шаров разных, изобретал и уйди-уйди. Не вызывает сомненья, \nчто тут и спал, и слегка погодя, во избежание перепалок с властями \nпредержащими, промыслил патент. Каким макаром — статья одиннадцатая, но заказов набрал — кот наплакал, приходилось вертеться \nпо местным составам и перелицовывать кой-что из старья; поднаторел и на инструментах. А то — зальешься, бывало, зарею на свалку — и ищи-свищи тебя, непоседу. Широко и вольготно, рискну \nзаметить, раскинулись отхожие эти поля; далеко-далеко отойдешь \nпорой в поисках радостей — затеряешься. За трудами все тянется \nнезаметно, вот уж полдень, и если не заморозки, то жаворонки. Заберешься на гору хлама передохнуть — дух займется: сторонушка \nхоть куда. Осмотри́тесь. На западе ветошница при долине граблями \nмусор гребет, на севере сучара трехпалая рыщет насчет пожрать, на \nвостоке сержант в запасе в ручье ковыряется — мотоциклетку бредит собрать по частям, а на юге шантрапа радеет по части чинариков. Мир, покойно, никто никому ничего, потому как человек человеку тут человек, не более; и дымки отечества повсеместно, как в то \nвосстание — мусор тлеет по-тихому, панорама — куда ни плюнь. \nИ такая к ней близость внутри щемит, что домой возвращаться — да \nну его. Привлекают нашего обитателя просторы своей земли, и рожна чужого он не взыскующий. В те же кварталы составил приличную, если выразиться, крышкотеку, собрание, то есть, разноцветных \nзакруток от саморазличных микстур: одеколоны, духи, да Вы знаете. В этом смысле неоценимую помощь советами и приветами подавала та западная ветошница, тетка в  теле, благовоспитанная \nи с опытом, а годков тянула с хвостиком на шестьдесят — деликатес, \nда и только. Приключение позадавнее, и что было, того не утаю: \nувлечение с ней выгорело мимолетное, как случилось, впрочем, и с ее \nвнучатой опечной или вроде того, в чем, понятно, винюсь, если требуется, задним числом. Плоти дамской соблазн велик есть, эта штука такая — вожделеем, и взятки гладки. Так и тут: начиналось почти \nчто дуриком. Фордыбачила, сторонилась, хмурилась, а поглубже \nкопнешь — все без разницы. Поговаривали по баракам, будто бы не \nв себе она, родом так, но я лично ничего исключительного бы не \nвменил. Единственно, голова у нее довольно-таки небольшая была \nнесуразно, да ветошница уверяла — до свадьбы дойдет, оправится; \nчто ж, дойдет так дойдет, опекунше видней. Один раз присылает \nсвою девулю со шкуркой какой-то, чтоб отмездрил,— и разволновался я на склоне судьбы. Только дурного не усмотрите, Фомич, \nя сначала лишь любопытство унял, как у нее обстоит-то, в ее, то \nесть, лета, знаете ли, ну и задвинул задвижку-то невзначай, от себя, \nчитайте, тайком. Потом прикидываю — чем лукавый не шутит, рискну, не все ж по расчету, с бабушками, неплохо бы и со внучатыми \nиногда, без ко́рысти. И случилось непоправимое, применился к невзрослой волнительно и сгоряча. Уговорились встречаться; когда \nпод лестницей утешим себя, когда под карбасом. Через ряд месяцев \nстороной, от знакомого гитариста, кому обязан по гроб нотной грамотой, узнаю, что матросят укромно мою малолетнюю какие-то речники. Я — сквозь пальцы, не мыло же, не обмылится, а дело их молодое, правое — поматросят да бросят. Орина меня заботила, ее \nконтакты сводили с рельс, и по ней, под карбасом, испытывая одиночество, горевал, по тряпицам елозя, которые сжечь бы, чтобы не \nпахли. А жировала на ветоши и взяла за привычку гулять по местам \nобнажения щекотливая дрянь вроде мух. Поначалу не беспокоили, напротив, приятствие извлекал, но ближе к Успению закусали, \nи поощрение кончилось. Жил да был во дыре уключины мизгирькрестовик. Все он днище, как небо высокое, паутиной оплел. Насекомых отлавливал я и в тенеты к нему кидал. Как же душу он тварям этим, бессовестный, вынимал аккуратно — ужасы. Паша, грядый, \nПаук ты мой, Петр племяннику из деревни писал, я не видел скушней события, чем январь без дрождей, доставляй — кровь из носу. \nСердцем верю, он продолжал, сердцем знаю — не подведешь, но \nумишко слаб, соблазняется: не привезешь ведь; ахти нам в таком \nразе, пьяницам. Именно тогда-то и шлет мне Павел известие с Фенистом. Илюша, сударь, пророк ты наш, вот ведь втемяшилось нам \nс Петром браги себе запасти, а поскольку ты и без этого добра нам \nжелаешь, и с буквой помог, то не поверишь ли, кроме того, в долг \nденьжат, ибо дрожди в Заволчье всему предивному уподоблю, а зиму без оных сравню с весной без сапог или с той же зимой, но без \nкатанок; сном кобылы рябой, подвизается, запорхает над нами, апостолами, так уж пожалуйста. Раздобыл я бумаги, песку, обмакнул \nя перо в чернильницу и залюбовался на двор, где снеговая бобылка, \nмной лепленная, схватила форменную капель. На календаре — конец \nбокогрея, но скалиться погоди, еще марток оставит без порток. Фениста, возражал я Павлу, напрасно не засылай, денег вам с дядей от \nИльи не придет, я не деньги пока точу — исцеления, да и то уважающим, а тем паче на пропивон: не довольно ли зашибать-то; но перед \nтем как я, может статься, вам денег пришлю, вы мне прежде доставьте с нарочным принадлежности. Которые? А те, которые вы и подобные вам преподобные спроворили в декабре, выбрав неразбериху сумрака и кутерьму буранчика. А до доезжачего сведения довел \nультимат, что раздор наш решить хлопотал бы келейно, без вынесения на высокие кровли, согласясь, что не волк и не выжловка, но \nкак бы ни то ни се, наподобие раннего вечера, и рассчитывал бы, \nуступчивый, на возврат одного вместо двух. И ответ. Протри, оскорбляет, светильники тела и наблюдай, как бы не выбросило ненароком во внешнюю темноту. И тогда я решил предпринять настоящее \nк Вам послание, а Паука с его просьбой забыть, презреньем наказав. \nСказано — сделаем, но не забыть — не к ночи будет помянуто, — как \nдушу он мухам хоботом своим вынимал под ладьей.\nИ задумался. Оря, ты Оря, раззуживали и тебя в изложинах на \nтот же манер. В будни получки, в аванца ль пятницы в знаменитых \nольхах за линией гужевались с тобой бестрепетно незнакомые мне \nподмастерья, удалые твои товарищи из путевы х ремеслух. Слабоваты вы, Орина Игнатьевна, как выяснилось, на передок, неровно \nк сладкому дышите и не гребень утратили на путях, но честь. За \nгранененький неполезной, кашинской, как вы только не ласкались \nоб них, злоблудучая фря. Что же, я бы тихо желал понять, никогда \nИлию так не баловала. Произрастала купина одна неявная, но густая и близкая, и в протяжные сумерки подмечал из нее непотребное; сумасброды вы были, матушка. Шел затем к малахольной, ища \nотыграться, но с ней — ровно с куклой: глядела как оловянная, не \nпотакая и в малой прихоти. В будень путейской получки, в аванца \nль пятницу, дербалызнул от чьих-то щедрот, подобрал чего-то железное у депо и пожду в знаменитых ольхах за линией. И показываются те стрекулисты, недомерки в  шестнадцать мальчишеских, \nи ведут мою профурсетку на лобную поляну любви. Я решил переждать — пусть начнется; тогда, отвагою более полный, и ударю из-за \nкургана коварным нехристем. Споро, пятеро, залили они буркалы \nсебе и ей и поехали кто во что горазд. Эх, мерекаю, пора не пора, иду \nсо двора. А после соображаю: поспешишь — насмешишь, ненароком \nспугнешь раньше должного, погожу. И перечитываю от нечего делать подобранный также билет за номером, чтоб не соврать, восемь \nтысяч четыреста двадцать два ровно, годящий для путешествия \nв прошлом году до такой незабвенной земли, как Луговая Суббота. \nПринял свое участье в Илье настоящий картон, очень принял. Представляете, Луговая Суббота, Фомич. То есть мало того что суббота, \nно еще ведь и лугами обрамлена, и пожалуй что даже и заливными. \nИ ливенка в них заливается. И гуляет себе выходной, отутюженный, \nа то и с тросточками, народ, улыбаясь лучисто чему-то правильному. \nВсё смиренно, никаких мордобитий, перебраниваются лишь извозчики с водовозами, но ведь и то зеваючи. А замыслили компанией \nв теньке посидеть — отойдите, судари, в кущи, к особым ларькам, — \nи отдыхайте во здравие. Вообразил себе эту нездешнюю алафу и беру обязательство: что б ни случилось, какие ни передряги, ни прочее — Луговой Субботе в текущем существовании визит нанести. \nИ завязал узелок. На галстуке. И когда мы с матрос-Альбатросовым свистнули себя всех наверх, резко оставив буфетец-вагон при \nпиковом интересе, и выдвинулись на полубак, то пароходец наш \nшвартовался как раз у должного дебаркадера. Мы сошли, осмотрелись и прокантовались в этой дыре пару недель — глушь да дичь. \nНа безденежьи и с уныния заторчали там, как тушканчики, и, имея \nбеседы с местными, говорили им, говоря: а еще Луговой Субботой \nзоветесь. Насшибали полтинник на курево и по веленью сердец почапали в Городнище дурить и, придя туда, ознакамливаемся: как \nжизнь молодая? Ничего, отвечают, нуждаемся понемногому. А закусить чем смекаете? Поторохами которыми-нибудь чрево набить — \nвот, смекаем почти всегда. И, придя туда, стали там быть и, избыточествуя недугами, бывать. В день дорожной получки, в аванца ль \nдень чекалдыкнул в пристанционном шалмане с путевиками-пропойцами — и ревную в купине с железом наперевес. Как выскочу, \nкак выпрыгну с секирой — ага, уличаю, ага! А они — ату меня, ату. \nНу, крепись, кричат, задрыга сякой! Четверо догоняют и сбили влет. \nИ топтали, интересуясь: что, законно попутали мы тебя, бляха-муха? Попутали, плачу, околыши, застукали, молоточки в петличках, \nкак есть законно. Рвусь — ан цепкие. Измордовали, что сидорову, \nизмызгали и — гляжу — повлекли, несчастливого, по серому шлаку \nда вниз мурлом. И втащили на насыпь, мизгирики, к рельсу проволоками колючими принайтовливают, неуемные. Льзя ли, гаврики, я страдал, что́ я — лисенок вам, что ли, какой. Цепкие, грабками \nхваткими к шпалам воньким совсем пригнетают, дышать не дают \nкаверзно. Прикрутили, как валенок к снегуру Норвегии, — вдоль \nи намертво, пассатижами, и слиняли, бояки. Жутковато и мне — \nжду скорого. И — как принято — стал ушедшее освежать: как пожил \nна этот раз, пристойно ли. Так прикинул и эдак, а ничего, главным \nобразом, характеристика. Господин слыл солидный, почтенный, \nдромом, что говорится, не грабил. И когда уже сыпались сверху \nогарки небесных дел, то возникла помочь эта странная все-таки, \nОря. Лисом бедненьким величала Илью несносного, проволоки откручивать принялась — и колотун ее бил. Я же всеми лопатками \nчуял, что подступает мой скорый, а проволок — масса, и толстые. \nМетров маловато оставалось ему, фонарями уничижал, шумел. Я сказал: Оря, дусенька, до встреч, отойди. А она: ну а вместе-то. Не со \nмной, отрицаю, с околышами ты вместях. А она: да об этом не злись, \nс ними так я, со шпингалетами, — побаловаться, побывать, с тобой \nже мне радость выпала, было мне с тобой как земле с травой, говорит, и нестрогость мою запамятуй — минуло, зажило, зубы острые, \nхвост долгий. Перепутала ты, мать, что-то путаешь, неужели всерьез я на лиса смахивал. У сороки боли, твердит, у вороны боли, говорит, у Ильи заживи, заговоривает. Я рванулся, рванулся, подернул, \nно частью не преуспел. Налетел, искромсал, горячий, руки-ноги по \nбелу свету поразметал. Прибыло полку доходяг, принимай, командир, пополнение. И лечебница. Не обнаружив в составе тела сего да \nэтого, я вскипел и потребовал утешения. Подплывает врачина в шапочке. На вопрос, где подруга, — он мне скупое: с ней худшее. Костоправу — ступай полечись-ка сам, разрешаю вам не поверить, \nишь — выдумали, я бузил. И потекло мое исцеление. Имелись газеты, шлепанцы, полагалось бритье.\nИ воспомнилось, как, лезвиями точеными хвалясь, хорохорился \nГурий в среде артельщиков, что не выпадало ему печали с доезжачим гонки гонять, обшаркаю, утверждал, как стоячего. В результате \nзаспорили, поставили на кон вина. Получив извещенье-уведомление, доезжачий приветствует. Столковались бежать нормально, \nпо-темному, и, обладая слепой дальнорукостью, как сейчас я их вижу — тот в латаном, тот в перелатанном. На разгоне рвали когти \nноздря в ноздрю, а стремиться им было от самой что ни на есть портомойни до Слободской протоки, до Кабацкого острова номер два — \nи назад. И понеслись коньками резать лед. Снег вивучий следы их \nподвига порошил, и рыбы атлетов не столько видели, сколько слышали, зато в скромном будущем одного участника сподобятся, может быть, поклевать; молись, рыбка большая и маленькая. Начал \nГурий за пару верст до поворота понаддавать, а доезжачий — поотставать, но принял Гурий немного правее, чем следовало, и угодил \nв полынью, в промоину в районе фарватера. Не застывает ни при \nкаких кондициях, и немало сонных тетерь-ямщиков и лунатиковскороходов там кануло. Недосчитались и Гурия, угодил — и течением его сразу под лед сволокло, так что псарь со своей стороны — \nлишь разнюнился. Тризну по волкобою порешили справлять без \nфактического его присутствия; ждать, пока он там выплывет неизвестно где, ребятня ли его бреднем вытянет, настроений не наблюдалось: народ в большинстве своих случаев ушел в недосуг. Вот \nи съехались к погребальщику. Вы Заитильщину знаете, спорам и прениям здесь предел, хотя б и сравнительный, положить невозможно: \nзаспорили про любовь — кто, мол, она, мадама эта, всецело прекрасная. Всяк свое утверждал; одни — подобно Василию Карабану — что \nВечная Жизня зашла погостить, одни — напротив: раздор, недород, \nсобытия. Я же, будучи пас, не встреваю, держу нейтраль. Но Вам — \nВам признаюсь, правда не для передачи другим, а то и так тут Илью \nза горохового шута держат. Для чего, с какой немыслимой стати \nупросила очкариков меднаук, чтоб мозги мне запудрили, — не разберу. Ныне же кается, ищет по всей реке: не среди ли вас тот, которого. Врут, что нет, потому что сами по уши втюрившись: не знаем, \nо ком печешься, но побывать с тобой каждый не прочь. И Гурий \nтуда же, даром что чудь. Ненаглядная, умолял, плес наш не узок — \nширок, и где ютится сей юноша, я не имею понятия, сознаю лишь, \nчто если бы заглянула на немного ко мне, то трен моей сути, узкий, \nкак точеное лезвие, стал бы широким, как этот плес. Перебыла, поговаривают, с ним накануне решительного его заезда с главным псарем всего ничего, но и оно очутилось просителю боком. Беспокоюсь: \nпогибель она моя суженая, и меня она, Оря, ищет, Фомич, тоскуючи. И не знаю, какие взять меры, — пропасть ли без вести или с повинной к ней приковылять самому. Но ни то ни другое пока немыслимо. Крылобыл — вот кому доверяю, кого хвалю, — Крылобыл \nегерей корил: вы, свет очей собственных, верните калеке калеково. \nВоссуетились, но искомого след простыл. Может, пропито, может, \nкинуто за ракитов куст, может, просто уплыло вниз. Но Илье-то \nчто за беда, Илье — вынь да положь, где взял. Заторчал, заторчал он \nсильно без них. Кому Слобода, Вышелбауши, кому Городнище, а он — \nсидит, будто на блевотине пес. Полюбуйтесь, к слову сказать, сколько \nих возле нашего заведения в оцепленьи дежурствует. Полагаете — \nподаяния ожидают? Отнюдь, им надеяться не на что, не заслужили \nпока. Нет, не подаяния — выдвиженцев ждут. И едва вы начнете \nизнутри выдвигаться, так эти псы собачьи катяхи свои леденелые \nглодать принимаются да языки показывают. Прост расчет их: вероятно, на эти мерзопакости глядя, то ли просто от свежего воздуха, \nвы и стравите им макароны по-флотски за гривенник. А вы пожадничаете — завсегдатай поблагородней расколется. А ждуны подбегут и все слопают. И хмелеют немедля, и свадьбы-женитьбы у них \nпроисходят безотлагательно, прямо на людях, и родятся в итоге такие ублюдки, что лучше и не показывайте. Родятся, окрепнут и, как \nдеды и матери, — по торной тропе, боковой знаменитой иноходью — \nмарш-марш к тошниловке. Ау, не обрывается здесь у нас поколений- \nто этих цепь, гремит-побрякивает, и не скроется с глаз наших чайная, стоящая на самом юру. Все мы детвора человеческая, дорогой, \nи пропустить по стопарю нам не чуждо. Вникните в мое положение \nпо-истинному теперь, как же тело Илье разгулять, не памятуя уж \nо более прикровенном-то. Препроводит подруга на лавочку у ворот — \nи сижу, маломошть, под соснами, соседок в соблазн ввожу. Чу! шапка снегу упала мне на чело; вольно ж тебе, дятел, гляди достукаешься, удод. Сбили, сбили с панталыку Илью, очутился он сбоку припеку, потешается публика над его субботами. Вот она, Заитильщина \nкак таковая, Фомич, и небытия вкусить нам не терпится. Но не \nизвольте побаиваться — перемелемся и назад. Все уже случалось на \nИтиле, все человеки перебывали на нем. Скажем, явится кто-нибудь, \nа его окликают: слышь, людин-чужанин, будешь с нами? Но пришлый их окорачивает: обознались, я свойский, ваш, памяти просто \nу вас нет обо мне, наливай. Утверждаю и я — околачивался, селился, \nбывал Джынжэрэла на Волчьей реке, пил винище, вострил неточеные, бобылок лобзал и отходил, когда надо, на промысел в отхожий \nпредел. Зато и мудрый я, как приблизительно Крылобыл. Тот примечает, настаивая: все — пьянь кругом, пьян приходит, и пьян уходит, а река течет и течет, и все как есть ей по бакену. Я согласен, но \nуточняю: пьян приходит и сидит безвылазно в кубарэ, а она течет, \nно берега остаются. А на берегах мы кукуем — и жизнь наша вечная. \nНо я заболтался с Вами, пора и на боковую. В случае чего забредайте почайничать без всяких обиняков — почайпьем, почаевничаем. \nПричем чем осмелюсь донять, так следующим: нету ли фантиков \nлишних? Любитель, к собирательству владею призванием. Приносите как есть, заодно с конфектами. Соль же, спички и прочие специальности постоянно при нас. А за почерк дурной, вне сомнения, \nизвиняйте, в известных торопях составлял, да и подлечился малость хозяйкиной милостью. И подпись благоволите. А если неграмотный — крест. Слушьте, откуда только фамилья подобная, где это \nя ее подцепил? Что ли, я цыганский барон, то ли просто ветром надуло. Как бы там ни было, вышеупомянутое надо мне как-нибудь \nна бумаге запечатлеть. И песочком присыпать. Всего исключительного.\n",

I will not pound\n  Pillows, sheets, and even the cover.\n  Take a look, again in my hovel\n  \n    Spooky bats are flying around.\n  \n  Go away! Enough being mean!\n  Why’d you bother the poor hunter now?\n  Anyhow, on his sickly pale brow\n  \n    The stamp of great torments is seen.\n  \n  They flew off. Ah, what great sadness.\n  \n    And alarm. And all that you’d wish.\n  \n  A washstand. A shovel. A boat.\n  A stile. Dandelion. A saddle.\n  A curtain. A needle in a haystack.\n  And myself, in the eye of my cat.\n  \n    White jasmine. A frog and a moth.\n  \n  \n    A completely dry paddle.\n  \n  The result of events is unknown.\n  Will the flashes turn into blunder,\n  Or the word of the prophet will thunder,\n  \n    Or will it just trickle a bit?\n  \n  Ocarina. A cart. And a glass.\n  Wooden ducks. Swallowwort. And a roach.\n  A seine. A nose-warmer. A jug.\n  A tench or a bream for some air\n  Will leap up from the mirrorlike stream,\n  It will leap and an instant hang there.\n  As a mark of a scream\n  \n    Or a question?\n  \n  A snail and a moth. And a nail.\n  And on this nail an old gun.\n  And a harrow. And eaves. Scraper brush.\n  Empty bottles. A mallet. A bun.\n  Jar with grease. Two Ostashkov-made boots.\n  And the swifts sitting under\n  \n    The eaves.\n  \n  \n    A completely different paddle.\n  \n  So, who’ll bellow in panic? The cutter\n  Who his thimble lost in the clutter?\n  Or the king who promised a meager\n  Half a kingdom for a decrepit horse?\n  Or the jaeger who, being too eager,\n  \n    Hit his pate with his saber full force?\n  \n  Islands. Or a dragonfly’s shadow.\n  River’s bend—like Death’s shiny scythe.\n  Freezing twigs on a distant meadow.\n  \n    Piece of fatback. And a boar’s hide.\n  \n  \n    And a flint stone.

A toad.\n  A washstand. And a puddle beneath.\n  Psst . . . on that shore, alone like a peg,\n  \n    Chuckled the angler with one leg.\n  \n  Smell of ozone. Illuminations.\n\n\nNote XXIX\n\nTales of the Factory Hunter\n\n\n  Entre perro y lobo\n  Or between wolf and hound,\n  Hung like sticking-out earlobe\n  Weightless crescent, skybound.\n  At that time nothing mattered,\n  But the drink on the ridge,\n  And the trains softly muttered\n  Somewhere far on the bridge.\n  And the forest abutting\n  The mill droned with its cogs,\n  From the wood it was cutting\n  They made boards, beams, and logs.\n  And the mug we’ve been sharing\n  Smelled of fish just a bit,\n  While the river flowed, bearing\n  Scents of sawdust and peat.\n  And the factory hunter\n  Was there telling us that\n  He’s a factory hunter,\n  He was telling us that.\n  This is always the process:\n  As the wine disappears,\n  Eyes turn watchful and glossy,\n  And the bottom appears.\n  But an evil smirk throttled\n  Smiles on lips, as a clue\n  That right now the third bottle\n  Came to be empty too.\n  Yet a certain green mare,\n  Somewhat skinny and bent,\n  Not for naught lived out there\n  Just beyond river’s bend.\n  And this lonesome babe-mare\n  For the drinkers who asked\n  Always kept as a spare\n  A big jug or a flask.\n  Like the crescent, my brothers,\n  Our boat was air-light.\n  So we, teasing each other,\n  Splashed with oars in the night.\n\n\nNote XXX\n\nChasing the Firebird\n\n\n  By the green saplings of heather, of heather,\n  Express is not going, but rapidly pacing\n  And inside in tall boots, in tall boots of leather\n  A hunter paces, the firebird chasing.\n  Strict with passengers is the train’s conductor:\n  Foresee no tea! It ran out long ago.\n  The barkeep’s strict too: Like a silent actor,\n  He ran out somewhere, and as long ago.\n  Yeah, thinks the owner of the boots and loosens\n  These boots of his, these boots, very tall,\n  While he is reading: “You should drink fruit juices!”\n  Command from heaven that hangs on the wall.\n  Dusk. Here’s the border. Now sleep goes to pieces.\n  And through the cars, comparing the rolls\n  Of mountain, river, even swamp polices,\n  Wander the guards, and check the boots’ soles.\n  Your boots! They’re here, but I have a comment:\n  The right is too narrow and the left too big.\n  You’re under arrest! But no, wait a moment,\n  Misunderstanding—it’s not you we seek.\n  Station. Some couplers. The air is quite misty.\n  A carpenter carries a plank or a tool,\n  One greaser jests with another, twisting\n  His own large schnozzle and playing the fool.\n  From his cigarette case, a train-platform turd,\n  With snotty nose and eyes out of kilter,\n  Articulating like one speech-impaired,\n  Gives an old hag five smokes without filters.\n  The train speeds on. And you’re still not sleeping.\n  Night shines and smells like the tar’s black stains.\n  Anxiously, hotly, like the mentioned bird leaping,\n  Alcohol rushes and shoots through your veins.\n\n\nNote XXXI\n\nEpitaphs of the Bydogoshchi Cemetery\n\n\n  A little church, abandoned,\n  Tall weeds grow all around,\n  And the cuckoo at sundown\n  Flies to the burial ground.\n  Is she counting the living?\n  Is she cursing the dead?\n  Is she mourning and grieving,\n  Or just singing like that?\n  At this time or another—\n  To make the story short—\n  Among these hillocks gather\n  The wardens for a snort.\n  Immediately—two glasses\n  And quickly the same blend,\n  You wonder how time passes,\n  When you’re with them, my friend.\n  You never find it boring\n  To listen to their lore,\n  ’Cause such amazing stories\n  You had not heard before.\n  And leaning, famished fellow,\n  Against the nameless mound,\n  Say, Bydogoshchi, hello,\n  Thanks for the alms we found.\n  Since drinks are so exquisite\n  We won’t mind what we’ve lost,\n  And each time, when we visit,\n  We’ll honor our hosts.\n  ✽\n  Here’s Pyotr—now worms’ fodder.\n  His nickname was Pike Pole.\n  All people called him Fyodor,\n  He called himself Yegor.\n  He was a fine gamekeeper,\n  A boor, though, and a thief,\n  So on the beam he pilfered,\n  He bet he could hang stiff.\n  You, who bet him—don’t fear,\n  Live and thank God, too:\n  Don’t wait when he’ll appear,\n  He’ll be waiting for you.\n  ✽\n  There’s Pavel—ferryman brave.\n  His life was in a slump;\n  He hoped that his own grave\n  Would save him from his hump.\n  He drowned and then was gone,\n  They looked for him—no use.\n  But he’d float up anon,\n  Bloated and without shoes.\n  The seventeenth of May,\n  They buried the poor chump.\n  His grave mound, by the way,\n  Is not a nicer hump.\n  ✽\n  Ivan, a glass man seasoned,\n  Thought that crystal stank,\n  And only for this reason,\n  From the bottle drank.\n  Shards of glass he’d ever\n  Chew as snacks—no pain,\n  But choked and he will never\n  Be the same again.\n  Love is happiness,\n  And happiness—glass.\n  But glassy happiness\n  Breaks with ease, alas.\n  ✽\n  He lived alone—a reclusive rake,\n  But no loose screws or peccadilloes.\n  They say that he could perfectly make\n  \n    Flutes from twigs of young pussy willows.\n  \n  You may blow flutes or blow your nose,\n  Bend horseshoes or the truth,\n  It’s not important, not even close,\n  \n    If company’s right, forsooth.\n  \n  The bitter lips of black poplar sway,\n  And hum a wind motif each morrow.\n  When Gury the hunter drank his gun away\n  He went out and died of great sorrow.\n  ✽\n  One would find no poacher greater:\n  Bought fish all day long,\n  But he used to sell it later\n  \n    For a song.\n  \n  Hapless poachers grudged the giver\n  His tenches and chubs.\n  They met Kolya by the river\n  \n    With their clubs.\n  \n  Sleep, Nikolka, Volga’s splashing,\n  Fires gently gleam.\n  Dream about a tench that’s thrashing\n  And a bream.\n\n\nNote XXXII\n\nEclogue\n\n\n  After lunch that was just a trifle,\n  I made sure my duster fit right\n  And took down my old faithful rifle\n  To inspect its barrel and sight.\n  I stepped out. It seemed that a clever\n  Dog decided to stick there with me.\n  ’Twas considered homeless, however,\n  Rather fat it appeared to be.\n  But I was not in the least troubled.\n  ’Cause what counts? That the dog doesn’t bite.\n  While “appeared,” “considered” are babble.\n  Yes—stepped out. Ah, what a sight!\n  I walked, while the sun’s rays were warming\n  The road’s dust, and crickets’ chimes\n  Grew louder. The eclogue was forming\n  By itself. Mumbling its rhymes,\n  I reached Polenov’s house, inviting,\n  Followed Savrasov’s winding tracks,\n  And soon, like in Turgenev’s writing\n  I spooked some of Aksakov’s ducks.\n  I raised my gun and shot, atremble,\n  But just the echo was my loot.\n  And the smoke’s color much resembled\n  The fur of leshy in the woods.\n  In the meantime, a gold leaf descended\n  From a branch of the cherished oak tree.\n  Why? I attempted to understand it,\n  But in vain. And what did I see?\n  In a village, when I was returning,\n  I saw happy peasants around,\n  In the tree shade dancing and whirling\n  To the old bayan’s whizzing sound.\n  And the moon seemed to be hanging\n  Like a fang of a wolf, bright and young.\n  Good to see you, my native hangouts,\n  I salute you, my native tongue.\n\n\nNote XXXIII\n\nReturn\n\n\n  The hunter pulled the trigger—but the gun misfired.\n  A crow emitted an untimely caw.\n  Somewhere, a gramophone screamed, inspired,\n  \n    And turnips smelled just like a life ago.\n  \n  Why do we rush, waste effort, as deranged,\n  And hasten through the plowed field and the glen?\n  When we come home—nothing’s really changed,\n  And in the mirror—the same good citoyen.\n\n\nNote XXXIV\n\nSagittarian\n\n\n  On the eve I was drinking alone in the light of the day,\n  And then until dark I was drinking with the fugleman bruiser.\n  I cried about something, and braving the thorns on the way,\n  I walked to the village, where I was known as a loser.\n  I dreamed that I died. And from above, someone filled with great might,\n  Whose face, though I was trying, I could not recognize,\n  Advised me: Listen, you Binger, get up and do your job right:\n  To serve as the Archer high to the heavens you’ll rise.\n  In forests of pine, where the razorbacks like to ramble,\n  And near the meadows that deer use as their feeding ground,\n  At night, as the moon gently shone on gray bushes of bramble,\n  The start of the way from here to there I had found.\n  ’Twas milky. The green buckhorn did not grow over there,\n  In clover could be heard no sweet moderate whine,\n  The acorns were not falling from maples as they do everywhere,\n  And millers of time at the dikes did not thirst for the wine.\n  I was ordered to follow the Scorpio—and soon I encountered\n  Winged boys who supplied me with a bow and a quiver;\n  They gave me a gold hunting bag and a box of colorful lanterns,\n  And a bucket-size jug of deluxe Hunter’s Vodka delivered.\n  I’m shooting and drinking. But much more I would relish\n  A gulp of the Volga home brew, and a pickle chaser I’d use.\n  These are just hunters’ tales that I live, I am happy, and flourish,\n  ’Cause drinking and hunting bring joy nowhere else but in Rus.\n  So stop being envious, while butting the stars with your eyes,\n  Of my way of walking—as soft as the eider duck’s down.\n  Here no one can ever outshine lonesome babes from the Valday,\n  And no one will give you a sleigh ride the way they had done.\n  I’m dead, not alive. And like the Brahmaputra are pure\n  My rags and my thoughts—now they rarely make me upset.\n  But tell me, is it true that, as earlier, in the morning azure\n  On pumpkins, like on the beaters’ foreheads, gleams sweat?\n\n\nNote XXXV\n\nSpackle\n\n\n  Make a cork to plug the drink\n  From the local paper,\n  Look out at Valday and think:\n  Where are you, my helper?\n  Apple. But in essence—crab.\n  Crab. But look closer—apple.\n  The slope it’s trying to grab,\n  Lethargic and slow, but supple.\n  Push your cap on brow, and free,\n  Feeling hunky-dory,\n  Make up, walking to the tree,\n  Stuff ’bout Wolf. A story?\n  Crabapple. And still—apple.\n  Apple. But really—crabapple.\n  Obsessed by its inner glow\n  And in its movements slow.\n  Wolf lived on one Volga shore,\n  Hound—the other roamed.\n  Couldn’t reach it as before\n  So he drank and groaned.\n  Crab. But in general—apple.\n  Apple. And slow, but supple.\n  In autumn its leaves are aflame\n  As brass and copper the same.\n  Daily, he drank a whole shtof,\n  Drank rotgut and groaned,\n  That one day he went off\n  And upset the Hound.\n  Crabapple. Look closer—apple.\n  Apple. Look again—crab.\n  Is it you or that chap,\n  The trash nicknamed Spackle?\n  Sharply pricks the naked foot\n  Stubble of mown grain,\n  Sit beneath crabapple, dude,\n  You will feel less pain.\n  Crabapple. Nickname—apple.\n  Apple. Occupation—crabapple.\n  Inebriated pretty well,\n  By the way, all go to hell.\n  With your teeth pull out the cork,\n  Made of paper crumpled.\n  What kind of a crazy dork\n  Scribbles all these pamphlets?\n  Crab. You got smashed—apple.\n  Apple. You’ll sober up—crab.\n  By the dusk blinded and grappled,\n  And by the wood louse enwrapped.\n\n\nNote XXXVI\n\nSupplemental\n\n\n  Settling down in a land far away\n  With a lonesome babe, fairly nifty,\n  I composed the Notes that today\n  To you in this bottle came drifting.\n  I did compose them on the go\n  Avoiding stress and strain—\n  In gardens, when the leaves were gone,\n  On boats or on the plain.\n  Or on the rafts, when it was light\n  ’Til midnight dimmed the skies,\n  Or in a sleigh, when snow gusts tried\n  To blind my wolfish eyes.\n  Composed them, and on hunting binged,\n  Drank with the wardens rotgut,\n  Or binge drank, ’til I got unhinged,\n  With fishermen their vodka.\n  When you have finished reading this,\n  To the post office make a dash,\n  And, gulping air like a beached fish,\n  Send these Notes out. But rush\n  The sending; folks can wait no more.\n  That’s how, for the best hoping,\n  In times of troubles, my pals wait for\n  Free bars to open.\n\n",

Собака\n  За мной увязалась одна.\n  Бездомной считалась, однако\n  Казалась довольно жирна.\n  Но это меня не касалось:\n  Казалась, считалась — все вздор,\n  Мне главное — чтоб не кусалась.\n  Я вышел. Вот это простор.\n  Из до́му я вышел. Дорога\n  Под скрежет вилась дергача,\n  Вилась и пылила. Эклога\n  Слагалась сама. Бормоча,\n  Достигнул поленовской риги,\n  К саврасовской роще свернул\n  И там, как в тургеневской книге,\n  Аксаковских уток вспугнул.\n  Навскидку я выстрелил. Эхо\n  Лишь стало добычей моей,\n  И дым цвета лешего меха\n  Витал утешеньем очей.\n  Какой-то листок оторвался\n  От ветки родимой меж тем.\n  Зачем? — я понять все пытался.\n  Все было напрасно. Затем,\n  Домой возвращаясь деревней,\n  Приветствовал группу крестьян,\n  Плясавших под сенью деревьев\n  Под старый и хриплый баян.\n  Но месяц был молод и ясен,\n  Как волка веселого клык.\n  Привет вам, родные свояси,\n  Поклон тебе, русский язык.\n\n\nЗаписка XXXIII\n\nВозбращение\n\n\n  Охотник выстрелил — ружье дало осечку.\n  Прохаркала ворона невпопад,\n  И граммофон наяривал за речкой,\n  И пахло репами, как жизнь тому назад.\n  Чего спешим, бездумно тратя силы,\n  Торопимся вдоль пашен и крушин.\n  Вернемся ведь — а в доме все как было,\n  И в зеркале — все тот же гражданин.\n\n\nЗаписка XXXIV\n\nСтрелецкая\n\n\n  Я пил накануне один до собаки и волка,\n  А после до мрака с матерым я пил вожаком.\n  И плакал о чем-то, шагая тернистой и колкой\n  Тропою в деревню, где слыл пропалы́м мужиком.\n  Мне снилось — я умер. И сверху начальственный кто-то,\n  Чьего я не мог рассмотреть, хоть старался, лица,\n  Направил: Запойный, вставай и ступай на работу:\n  Подымешься в небо, послужишь созвездьем Стрельца.\n  Во Вшивом бору, там, где вепри особенно дики,\n  У тех ли полян, где жируют оленьи стада,\n  В купинах седых, осиянных луной, куманики\n  Нашел я начало дороги отсюда — туда.\n  Она была млечной. Не рос подорожник зеленый,\n  Не слышался в клевере сладкий умеренный гуд,\n  Не сыпались, как им положено, желуди с клена,\n  И времени мельник не кушал первач у запруд.\n  Мне было назначено следовать за Скорпионом.\n  Пернатые мальчики выдали лук и колчан,\n  Ягдташ золотой и коробку цветных лампионов,\n  Стрелецкой отборной вручили полведерный жбан.\n  Стреляю и пью.

Чисты мои, как Брахмапутра,\n  Лохмотья и помыслы — убыло с ними забот.\n  Скажите, а что, неужели, как прежде, поутру\n  На тыквах блестит, как на лбах у загонщиков, пот?\n\n\nЗаписка XXXV\n\nПаклен\n\n\n  Туже заткни сиволдай\n  Пробкой из местной газеты.\n  Выйди, взгляни на Валдай,\n  Вспомни о ком-нибудь: где ты?\n  Неклен.

  layout: "narrative",
  content: "That is how, trying to collect his thoughts, the hunting \nguard Yakov Ilyich Palamakhterov, a man of middling height, ordinary age, and easily forgettable face, \nphilosophized. Yakov Ilyich lived beyond the Volga, in a small \nbut uncomfortable ranger’s cabin at the edge of the forest, on \nthe muddy shore, keeping the old warden Krylobylov company. Palamakhterov lived, sewed slippers and hi-tops, looked \nat the water, drank, went hunting, snacked on potatoes in skins, \nand, wishing to reflect on who he was, tried to gather his \nthoughts. On the kitchen table, among the objects of trapping \nand household equipment, he frequently noticed a kerosene \nlamp. Now and then, the fuel in the container would end and \nthe wick would mercilessly smoke. At the same time it would \nbecome clear that in the copper teakettle, patched once by a \ncertain grinder that became a total drunk and ended badly, in \nthe teakettle with a handmade wire handle, now used to store \nkerosene, not even a few drops of the latter could be found. I \nhad a teakettle with me—Palamakhterov mumbled, looking at \nsparks detaching from the smoldering wick and flying up the \ntransparent contraption—a teakettle, my only joy during my \ntravels in the Caucasus. Thinking occasionally about this \nmountainous region, Yakov Ilyich smiled, recalling that as a \nboy, having read a lot of nonsense, he passionately dreamed \nabout it; later the Caucasus, like all the other places he never \nhad a chance to visit, became completely indifferent to him. \nWhenever he realized that he is thinking aloud, Palamakhterov \nwould get surprised. And he would speak, apparently addressing only himself, because, as a rule, he was at home alone: Krylobyl almost never dropped in here. After spending a while \nbeyond the river, Yakov would come back to the guard post \nwithout yeast and before leaving again to get it, he would passionately bang for hours on the iron plate that hung on the \nbirch tree behind the kennel; at that point, its dwellers would \nget extremely excited. And the gloomy and spiteful beggar \nwoman, whom Yakov Ilyich and Fedot Fyodorovich used to \npick up in the spring at the fish market and adapt to their bachelor needs—she, having left in the morning to pick mushrooms, not infrequently would be slow coming back, and before the first frosts she would disappear for good. And \nPalamakhterov would reassure himself: One should not think \nthis way but the other. At the same time, he even tried to gesticulate, but the result was unnatural and silly, like in theater, \nand afterward he would admonish himself, standing motionlessly and having dropped his hands, listless from confusion. \nOne needs to think with more energy, he would emphasize, \none has to inculcate some kind of certainty in the mind, one \nhas to constantly—here he would decide to stop, planning to \nfind for sure a replacement for the awkward word that was getting ready to finish his phrase, but he would not stop soon \nenough and the word would break loose, jump out—every \nday, Yakov Ilyich would say, keep inculcating. Strange, smacking of ventriloquism, the word would hang in the semidarkness as a row of letters of different size, sickly shining with a \nhazy photogen radiation and, after being written, would turn \nout even less welcome than the uttered one. Agitated, Yakov \nIlyich would look at it and completely unexpectedly—after all, \nit had not snowed yet—would find himself lying in a wide \nsleigh with his legs in front and with his head hanging or even \ndragging behind, and every time, when the sleigh passed a \nbump or a snow-covered stump, letting it pass between the runners, his head—regardless of how much Yakov tried to raise it \nup soon enough to prevent the blow—would knock on the fly \nwith its occiput against the obstruction and bounce with some \nkind of a nutlike crack or crunch, and right away, having rattled \nwith its teeth as if it were dead, would fall back again. The situation was even more serious because there was no hat; the latter, \nas Palamakhterov was compelled to conclude, most likely fell \noff; otherwise, feeling pity for himself—feeling pity, although, \nas a result of everything befalling him, he experienced neither \npain, nor the obvious inconvenience, nor humiliation, as if everything were happening not to him, as if he were looking at it \nfrom the side—otherwise, the whipper-in considered, otherwise the blows wouldn’t have been so severe. However, having \nfallen off, the hat—as he would notice later—was not getting \nlost but, tied by the strap to the hanger of his sheepskin jacket, \nwas dragging behind the sleigh, like the head, even though the \nlatter bounced more than dragged. On flat spots, when it was \nnot shaking, his consciousness would come to life. Smiling at \nthe small multicolored balls recklessly scurrying in the heights \nover the felts of otherworldly billiards—it is the freeze, that is \nthe reason it is like that—he would think about the head: It \nstiffened in the cold, and now it is hard, and now it bounces \nand cracks. And even if he suspected in the given explanation a \ncertain falsehood and cunning, especially because he could \nnot detect a particularly strong freeze, it satisfied him completely and he did not require any other. They are moving at a \nbrisk pace. But the kneeling coachman who installed himself at \nthe very front of the sleigh keeps urging on, flinging into the \ndarkness of the thicket the squawks and whizzes of the prodding. Worried about his hat with earflaps, Yakov Ilyich keeps \nlooking back—inasmuch as he is able to look back at all—to \nmake sure it did not get lost. But no, as before, it bounces and \ndrags, keeping up with those riding in the mobile wagon train, \nand Yakov Ilyich, with an intention to thank for the performed \nservice, for the fact that someone with a foresight took care of \nhis headgear—tied it like that—but not knowing whom to \nthank, addresses the coachman, in an inscrutable way having \nguessed that precisely he, the coachman, had tied it, and that \nnow his, Palamakhterov’s, fate depends on him, and it is advisable to flatter the fellow traveler, tell him something nice, \nsomehow win his favor; and so, Yakov Ilyich addresses the \nstranger, speaking for some reason in a completely uncharacteristic-for-him voice of somebody unknown: Thank You, I’m \nso grateful, You’ve secured my hat, else I am ridin and simply \nhave no clue, where my hat can be, and it is, as it turns out, right \nhere, attached to the hanger; much obliged, I wish You great \nhealth, and don’t be angry that Krylobylchik and I treated the \nsharpener like that—anythin can happen in the daily grind. \nWhat’s done is done, we’ve lost our temper, made mischief, it \nhappens to everyone, but, after all, as far as he’s concerned, he’s \nno saint either; we have forgiven him the stolen storm lamp as \na deductible loss, and yet, who has ever heard of exterminatin \nthe hounds. Does he think that ’cuz he is an invalidual, everythin is permitted? No, we have certain limits set for the disabled \ntoo, even if they’re wider, but in addition he, the petty slanderer, \nstarted scribblin them denunciations that, supposedly, we pilfered his crutches, as if there were no other wardens. The voice, \nthe words, and the manner—everything in his speech smacks \nof artificiality and affectation, everything in his monologue \nseems strange to him. However, aware of this, he does not feel \nany awkwardness; on the contrary, he derives pleasure from ingratiating himself with the coachman, and he would like the \ntrip to last and last, and he, Yakov Ilyich, a pitiful, hapless, and \ngrateful person, with this head of his, would like to be carried \nand carried somewhere, and keep saying quietly and deferentially: Thanks for my hattie, with earflappies, tied to the \nhangerkin—and would sweetly pity himself, and perhaps, if he \nwere able to cry, he would shed a few tears. Because, he tries to \nphilosophize, what is suffering, what is it as such, indeed, in its \nessence, if it is analyzed thoroughly? How can it be labeled, defined, at long last? But not being able to elucidate the essence \nof suffering and analyze it thoroughly, as well as define and label it, the hunter makes peace with the circumstances and no \nlonger wants to worry about anything at all, but wishes that \neverything would end, be finished, pass, and never repeat itself \nagain. To cross over, cross over, he fantasizes, to turn into a \nchilling rain of Brumaire and to hover above the bazaar junk of \nthe suburbs, above some utterly remote versta, why not the \nthirty-fourth, counting from the point where it is convenient \nor desirable; but not counting, because it is not convenient and \nnot desirable. Counting nothing, to linger incessantly above \nthe muck of gutters and retention ponds, above the loam of \ngardens and wiesenboden of meadows, above the bunch of \nplywood barracks, warehouses, and shacks; to hang for a long \ntime, disgracing the winged ones—black and large, and despising their migrations, and chasing the sentries and neighborhood dogs under the awnings and into their booths; to \nremain, piercing from side to side the eruptions of the factory \npipes, made of sheet metal or brick, and forcing the smokes of \nthe fire-breathing switchers to spread over their paths; and to \nwalk across the roofs of depots, imitating the railroad roofer of \nthe corresponding section of the track, mumbling and monotonously babbling the same thing, and like a drunken glass installer from the same section, carrying on nonsense and a basket of shards to glaze the yawning gaps of vistas; and to last, \nincreasing the bedlam of crossroads and telegraph wires, and \nmessing up the look of the old-fashioned—once ballroom, but \nnow workday—tailcoats and top hats of garden hay-men, \nscarecrows, and all the other characters.\n",

  content: "Так, пытаясь собраться с мыслями, философствовал охотничий \nсторож Яков Ильич Паламахтеров, человек заурядного роста, обычного возраста и без труда забывающегося лица. Яков Ильич жил за \nВолгой, в небольшой, но неуютной казенной избе у края рамени, на \nзаболоченном берегу, составляя компанию старому егерю Крылобылову. Паламахтеров жил, шил и́чиги, чубуры, смотрел на воду, пил, \nходил на охоты, закусывал картошкой в мундире и, желая разобраться в себе, пытался собраться с мыслями. На кухонном столе, среди \nпредметов ловитвенной и домашней утвари, зачастую он замечал \nкеросиновую лампу. Бывало, во фляге выходило горючее, и фитиль \nнемилосердно коптил. При этом становилось понятно, что в медном чайнике, луженном некогда одним спившимся с круга и дурно \nкончившим точильщиком, в чайнике с самодельной проволочной \nручкой, в котором хранили теперь керосин, не наберется и нескольких капель последнего. Со мною был чайник, — глядя, как отрываются от тлеющей ткани и летят вверх по прозрачному приспособлению искры, мямлил Паламахтеров, — чайник, единственная моя \nотрада в путешествиях по Кавказу. Рассуждая порою об этой горной \nстране, Яков Ильич усмехался тому, что мальчиком, начитавшись \nразного вздору, бурно мечтал о ней; позже Кавказ, подобно всем \nостальным местам, где ему не случилось бывать, стал вполне ему \nбезразличен. Когда осознавал, что думает вслух, Паламахтеров тогда удивлялся. И говорил, адресуясь, по-видимому, только к себе, \nибо, как правило, находился в доме один. Крылобыл сюда почти никогда не заглядывал. Прогуляв какое-то время в заречье, он опять \nвозвращался на кордон без дрожжей и, прежде чем снова уехать за \nними, в сердцах бил часами в клепало, висевшее на березе за псарней; обитатели ее возбуждались тогда чрезвычайно. А угрюмая злая \nнищенка, которую Яков Ильич с Федотом Федоровичем по весне \nподбирали на рыбном базаре и приспосабливали для своих холостяцких нужд, — та, с утра уйдя по грибы, нередко не шла и не шла, \nа к ледоставу и совсем пропадала. И Паламахтеров уверял себя: думать не так следует, а вот как. При этом он даже пытался жестикулировать, но получалось картинно и глупо, будто в театре, и далее \nон поучал себя, стоя недвижимо и вялые от смущения руки уронив. \nНужно энергичнее думать, подчеркивал он, какую-то определенность \nв уме выковать, постоянно — тут он решал остановиться, имея в виду непременно найти замену тому неловкому слову, что готовилось \nуже завершить фразу, но остановиться не успевал, и слово срывалось, выскакивало, — всякий день, говорил Яков Ильич, выковывать. \nСтранное, отзывающееся чревовещанием, оно повисало в полутемном пространстве рядом разновеликих литер, болезненно светившихся коптящим фотогеновым излучением, и, будучи начертанным, \nоказывалось еще непрошеннее произнесенного. В волнении Яков \nИльич рассматривал его и совсем неожиданно — ведь снег-то еще \nне выпадал — обнаруживал себя лежащим в розвальнях ногами вперед, а голова свисала и даже волочилась, и каждый раз, как сани \nминовали бугор или запорошенный пень, пропустив его меж полозьев, голова — как Яков ни силился загодя, упреждая удар, приподнять ее — с маху стукалась затылком о препятствие и подскакивала \nс каким-то ореховым хрустом или щелчком, и тут же, клацнув зубами, как мертвая, вновь запрокидывалась. Положение усугублялось \nтем, что на ней не было шапки; последняя, как Паламахтерову следовало умозаключать, вероятно, слетела, иначе, с жалостью к себе — \nс жалостью, хотя ни боли, ни явственных неудобств от всего с ним \nпроисходившего, ни унижения он не испытывал, будто все это происходило не с ним, будто он глядел на это со стороны, — иначе, рассуждал доезжачий, иначе удары не были бы такими жестокими. Но, \nслетев, шапка — он замечал со временем — не терялась, а, привязанная за штрипку к петле полушубка, волочилась вослед за санями, \nголове подобно, которая все-таки более скакала, чем волочилась. \nНа ровных местах, когда не трясло, сознание оживлялось. Улыбаясь \nмелким разноцветным шарам, азартно снующим в высоте по сукнам \nзапредельного биллиарда, — это мороз, это она от него такая, — о голове размышлял, — задубенела на холоде, вот и упругая, вот и скачет и щелкает. И пусть он подозревал в настоящем объяснении некую фальшь и лукавство, тем более что и мороза-то особого не ощущалось, оно совершенно устраивало его, и никакого иного ему не \nтребовалось. Едут опрометью. Но коленопреклоненный возница, \nпристроившись у самого передка, все погоняет, выбрасывая в морок чащи клекот и хрип понуканий. Исполнившись опасений насчет ушанки, Яков Ильич часто оглядывается, поскольку он вообще \nможет оглянуться, — как бы не потерялась. Да нет — по-прежнему \nи прыгает, и волочится, поспевает за едущими мобильным обозом, \nи Яков Ильич, вознамерившись поблагодарить за оказанную услугу, за то, что столь дальновидно побеспокоились о его головном уборе — привязали вот, но не зная, кого благодарить, обращается к правящему, неисповедимым образом догадавшись, что это именно он, \nвозница, ее привязал, и от него зависит ныне его, Паламахтерова, \nучасть, и следует улестить спутника, сказать ему что-то доброе, както расположить к себе. Яков Ильич обращается к незнакомцу, говоря почему-то совсем не свойственным себе голосом — голосом непонятно кого: спасибо вам, благодарствуйте, шапчонку-то мою прикрепили, а то еду и прямо ума не приложу, где шапка, а она вот она, \nоказывается, где — к петельке прикреплена, премного обязан, я здоровия вам пожелаю вполне, а что мы с Крылобыльчиком к артельщику так отнеслись — так не гневайтесь, мало ли чего не бывает в быту. Конечное дело, погорячились, набедокурили, с кем не случается, \nно ведь и он же хорош со своей позиции; лампу краденую штормовую мы простили ему как списанную, но где это видано — гончаков \nизводить; думал, если он инвалид, то и дозволено ему все? Нет, границы у нас некоторые и для калечных намечены, пусть и шире, да \nеще и кляузы начал строчить, ябеда мелкая, будто мы его костыли \nутянули, словно иных егерей не имеется. И голос, и слова, и манера — все отдает неестественностью и елеем в речи его, все чуждо ему \nв его монологе. Но, понимая это, неловкости никакой не чувствует, \nему, напротив, приятно заискивать перед возницей и хочется, чтобы \nпоездка длилась и длилась и чтобы его, Якова Ильича, с этой его \nголовой, все везли и везли куда-то, личность жалкую, беспомощную \nи благодарную, а он бы все твердил негромко и вкрадчиво: шапчонку мою, ушаночку, к петельке — и сладко бы сожалел о себе, и, может статься, если бы удалось поплакать, то и всплакнул бы немного. Ибо, пытается философствовать он, что есть страдание? что оно \nтакое есть, в самом-то деле, по самой своей сути, когда разобраться \nпо-настоящему? как обозначить, определить его, в конце-то концов? Но, не в силах будучи выделить суть страдания и по-настоящему разобраться в нем, равно определить и обозначить его, ловчий \nсмиряется с обстоятельствами, и ему уже не хочется хлопотать ни \nо чем решительно, но желается, чтобы все кончилось, завершилось, \nпрошло и никогда уже более не повторялось. Перейти, перейти, фантазирует он, обернуться знобящим дождем Брюмера и повиснуть \nнад бутафорским хламом предместья, над некой донельзя заштатной верстой, отчего бы не тридцать четвертой, считая оттуда, откуда нужно или откуда угодно; но не считая, поскольку не нужно \nи не угодно. Ничего не считая, заладить над пакостью сточных канав \nи отстойников, над супесью огородов и суволочью нив, над гурьбою \nфанерных бараков, пакгаузов и хибар; зарядить, унижая достоинство черных, больших, презирающих перелеты крылатых и гоня под \nнавесы и в будки будочников и псов окрестных; зазнобить, наискось \nпронизывая изверженья фабричных дуд, жестяных и кирпичных, \nи заставляя стелиться дымы огнедышащих маневровых по путям \nих; и идти по крышам складских помещений в подражанье путейскому кровельщику соответствующей дистанции, бубня и долдоня \nодно и то ж и — как нетрезвый стекольщик той же дистанции, неся \nоколесицу, осколками полную всклянь, застеклять зияющие провалы перспектив — и длиться, усугубляя кутерьму перепутий, проволок и портя вид старомодных — некогда бальных, а ныне присутственных — фраков и шляп огородных чучел, вороньих пугал и остальных персонажей.\n",

  content: "Citizen Pozhilykh. After the end of days, at azure hour, \nwe’re relaxin with some folks on the pant-washin \ndeck; we’re dusk-baskin. And, as usual, thru the fogs, \nfrom the other side of the river, emerge the notorious never- \nto-be-forgotten. Either Aladdin Rakhmatullin accidently \nflashes his teeth, or Kolya Helperov winks softly-softly, or that \ntall one, with a stolen baluster of the same length, appears—\nleads the weepin old woman with a creel: Permit me to introduce my widow; for almost a century she’s been roamin without a fella, thank you—she finally met the Wintry Man. And \nKrylobyl surfaces from beyond the river, walkin like on dry \nland: Why are you sittin here? Well, just so. We’re waitin for \nthe Heavenly Kingdom—and what the heck brings you here? \nCourage, I am in possession of good news. Well, out with it, \nif you ain’t lazy! He begins: Do you remember how we were \nburyin Gury? Who knows whether Gury or not Gury, I says, \n’cuz personally I did not happen to grace this empty burial \nwith my presence, considerin it incorrect, but accordin to the \ngrievin bereavers, the empty package was buried with honors. Precisely, says the ranger, and just before we carried him \nout, for the sake of greater respectability we agreed to stick \ninside somethin similar, thinkin that if he appears in person, \nwe’ll make the exchange. Unfortunately, nothin either similar or dissimilar was found and nobody had nothin—all of \nthem, devils, wagered and lost everythin, brother to brother, \nall of them made each other poor as church mice. But on the \ncot in the dayroom there happened to recline a certain unassumin guest from among the drifters who, as a result of havin \ntoo many, kept slurrin his words and feelin shabby and faint. \nIn order for his face not to disturb anyone, they turned him \ntoward the wall, to the east, covered him with a mat, and to \nanswer who he is would be difficult from the side; and nobody \nparticularly tried; after all, here everythin is simple: You got \nsmashed, you’re snorin thru both holes—so you’re welcome \nto rest, whoever you are, only don’t make a ruckus. And the inventory—whether his or not his, who can tell?—was blatantly \nstandin in the icon corner under Our Lady of Sorrows. So we \nput these sticks in and carried them out—both for edification \nand for the sake of their not too great, but still, durin a fishin \nlull, resemblance. And now, in my involuntary repasts, I am \nrackin my brains: Wasn’t it ’cuz of these supports that the wardens bumped Ilya off, and he the hounds, and wasn’t it he who, \naccordingly, was restin at that moment on the stove bench? I’m \nrackin my brains back and forth and everythin seems to fit: \nNothin else, but the grinder’s sticks were buried then; I should \nprobably go and tell. Well, everythin is turnin out perfect, I \nsays to Krylobyl, and so we need to dig them up tomorrow. \nAnd so tomorrow we’ll dig them up. Only how did I manage to \nget without them after the wake to Gorodnishche, with what, \nI’d like to ask, did I overcome the wolf and ascended to my \nown haunts? It’s your concern, Petrikeich, don’t drag us into \nyour seductive scandals. And he fades in the smoke, gets lost in \nthe haze, but the next day disturbs again. Hail to you, my kind \nsoul, Fedot Fyodorov, may your good deed be recorded where \nit should, and may all your trespasses be forgotten, especially \nmy drownin. Courage, sayeth he, I’m in possession of good \nnews. Right, old man, we’ll set out at dawn, though we should \nsharpen our spades first; with unsharpened ones we’ll be pokin \nuntil the Last Judgment: It’s covered with sod, I reckon. These \nare our latest, Fomich. Excuse me, it turns out, for unfounded \nworries, so long, be who You are, and have Yourself a happy \nresurrection, so to speak. And the last remarks. What they are \nbabblin about Ilya—don’t believe it, rein in the evil tongues. \nJust look at them—they got too eager, wanna pin all the dogs \non me, while I only had enough time to gun down in revenge a \ncouple of Vizsla bitches, and even those worth nothin. One, I \nheard, always pretended to be deaf, the other mute, intentionally did not bay at all durin the hunt. Well, miserable pooch, \ncome here, lick my scabs without holdin the grudge, gimme \nsome healin, whenever you want. And how come your rump \ngot so thin? When you were alive you weren’t such a skin and \nbones. Say—I believe, say—at dawn, and we’ll set out, we’ll \nrescue our accessories. Well, let’s shoot the breeze for a while, \nno need to keep the mouth shut and pout without reason. Or \nmaybe mysterious for you are these words of mine?\n",

И как \nправило, проступают через туманы, из-за реки, пресловутые присной памяти. То Аладдин Рахматуллин залыбится невзначай, то Угодников Коля ненавязчиво подмигнет, то этот долгий, который со \nслегой краденой и с нее же длиной, возникает — старуху заплаканную с туеском ведет: разрешите рекомендовать, моя вдова, чуть не \nвек без мужика мыкалась, спасибо — Зимарь-Человек наконец ей \nвстретился. И выдвигается из-за реки Крылобыл, выступает, как посуху: что сидите? Да так. Царствия Небесного дожидаемся — а тебя \nкакая нелегкая принесла? Ободритесь, располагаю благим известием. Что ж, выкладывай, если не лень. Начинает. Гурия как хоронили — помните? Гурия не Гурия, говорю, а лично я порожнее погребение это присутствием пропустил как неверное, но упаковку пустую, по мнению скорбевших печальников, зарыли с почестями. Точ но \nтак, объездчик рассказывает, а еще перед самым выносом ради солидности вящей предприняли мы что-нибудь подобное посунуть \nвовнутрь, а буде объявится сам, то заменим. На беду, ни подобного, \nни бесподобного не выяснилось ничего и ни у кого бы то ни было — \nвсе, чертяки, свояк свояку проспорили, каждый каждого по миру \nпустил. Но случился во светелке на лежаке один недоподлинный \nгость из приблудных, которому с перебору вступило в речь и сделалось нехорошо и расслабленно. Личностью, дабы не беспокоила, \nобратили его к стене, на восток, принакрыли рогожею, и ответить, \nкто есть таков, — со стороны бывало бы затруднительно; да никто \nособо и не вдавался, у нас ведь попросту: отрубился, сопишь в две \nдырки — ну и соизволь почивать, кто бы ни был, лишь бы не озорничай. Инвентарь же — его, не его — как докажешь? — торчал непотребно в красном углу, под Скорбящей. Значит, снасти-то эти и сунули, и снесли — как в назидание, так и ввиду их не слишком, но на \nбезрыбье — подобности. Теперь на досугах невольных мозгую: не \nиз-за тех ли опор егеря Илюху-то ухайдокали, а он — гончаков, и не \nон ли, следственно, на лежанке тогда почивал. Так мозгую и перетак, а все сходится: не иначе — точильщиковы клюшки в тот раз \nпогребли, пойти, вероятно, сказать. Вон как славно все обустраивается, Крылобылу я говорю, стало быть, завтра же надо бы их и отрыть. Стало быть, завтра же и отроем. Только как это я после тризны \nбез них в Городнище попал, чем чекала, спрашивается, перемог и восвояси взошел? Это забота твоя, Петрикеич, нас в свои безобразия \nсоблазнительные не впутывай. И линяет в дымах, погибает в маревах, но назавтра тревожит сызнова. Исполать тебе, душа-человек, \nФедот Федоров, да зачтется где следует добро твое, да оставлены \nбудут твои все долги, а мое утопленье особенно. Ободритесь, глаголет, располагаю благим известием. Точно, старый, зарей и отправимся, правда, заступы наточить бы, неточеными до Судилища проковыряемся: задернело, поди. Вот такие у нас новинки, Фомич. Извиняйте, оказывается, за зряшное беспокойство, бывайте, являйтесь \nсебе кем являетесь, и — счастливого Вам воскресения, так сказать. \nИ последнее. Что об Илье болтают — тому не верьте, одергивайте \nзлых языков. Ишь — разохотились, всех собак на меня склонны вешать, я ж единственно пару выжловок в отмщенье из берданы успел \nпорешить, но и те бестолковые. Одна все, слышно, глухой прикидывалась, вторая — немой, на гоне голоса не подавала намеренно. Нука, псина несчастная, поди сюда, полижи мне струпья мои незлопамятно, поврачуй, когда хочется. И чего это ты крупом столь перепала тут, в бытии не такая была дохлятина. Верю, скажи, зарей, скажи, \nи отправимся — выручим свои принадлежности. Ну, давай покалякаем, зачем напрасно в молчанку играть да кукситься. Или сокровенны тебе слова мои?\n",

  content: "Note XXXVII\n\nPost Scriptum\n\n\n  Woe is us; this clime’s bad for health and the mood,\n  Every day chains of clouds just get denser,\n  The one who later will find these Notes should\n  Burn and scatter on the Wind Rose my verses.\n  Like the Mongol Horde’s treasure, its crown in old tales,\n  Amztarakhan once vanished, passed on,\n  And like roaches that fed in the Khan’s ponytails\n  With time passing, would also be gone;\n  Like during the thaw, tracks of sleighs and of elks\n  Melt and leave no marks to observe;\n  Like—without a trace also—did vanish the works\n  Of nations and the nations themselves;\n  Like after a bottle, despair may be banished\n  Though at first our souls wrings and smotes,\n  The same way—seeking no glory—may vanish,\n  Together with the bottle, these Notes.\n  But who needs this stuff? Therein lies the rub.\n  Why did I, the hunter-ragpicker,\n  On the face of existence a blemish, a scab,\n  A lecher, and a pimp who loves liquor,\n  Compose all these Notes at this river’s spring\n  And floated them down in a hurry?\n  Such a meaningless loss of candles and ink\n  And a waste of the force of the current.\n  How annoying: All these years irretrievably lost,\n  Playing, singing, and having much fun;\n  You gaze in the tumbler—and you’re just a ghost.\n  Alas, things look bad, you are done.\n  Now I darn my old sack during pre-winter’s spell,\n  Fix the fishnets, and sharpen tools’ tines,\n  But I know—pushy buds will stealthily swell\n  \n    And burst out from their narrow confines.\n  \n  So I dare you to burn, you dumb-as-a-bell,\n  My amazing, ingenious lines!\n\n",
