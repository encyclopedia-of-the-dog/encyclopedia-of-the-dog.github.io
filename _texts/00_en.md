## Between Dog and Wolf

<p class=byline>Translated by Alexander Boguslawski</p>

- <p style="text-align:center"><em>To My Pals in Dispersion</em></p>

- I’m fond of friendly conversation
- And of a friendly glass or two
- At dusk or entre chien et loup—
- As people say without translation.
- {:.indent-7} --Aleksandr Pushkin, *Eugene Onegin*

- The young man was a hunter.
- {:.indent-7} --Boris Pasternak, *Doctor Zhivago*
